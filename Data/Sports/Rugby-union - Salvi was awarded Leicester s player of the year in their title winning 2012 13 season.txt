Australian flanker Julian Salvi will join Exeter Chiefs from Premiership rivals Leicester in the summer 
Everyone will know him as a defensive player but in reality we were really pleased with his attacking qualities 
Both teams go into the final round of Premiership fixtures in the top four though neither are guaranteed a place in the play offs 
I ve been very impressed with his form this season and very impressed with his durability added Baxter 
I think he s going to be a fantastic role model for a few of our guys
