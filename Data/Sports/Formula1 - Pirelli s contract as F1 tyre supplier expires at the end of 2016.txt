Formula 1 bosses are considering allowing teams freedom to choose the tyres they take to each race 
Tyre supplier Pirelli currently chooses two types of tyre for each track out of the four compounds they supply 
The proposal which originated from the Force India team and to which governing body the FIA is open is to allow teams to pick two compounds themselves 
Letting teams choose would introduce extra variety and the potential to mix up the field from race to race 
However Pirelli is concerned there would be a risk of some teams picking tyres that were too soft for certain tracks so they could achieve better grid positions by using tyres that were unsuitable for races 
Pirelli s motorsport director Paul Hembery said nobody had spoken to the supplier to explain why they need to do it adding the change could still result in teams having the same compounds for a race weekend 
He said the company took into account track layout conditions surface and temperature ranges before selecting tyres 
Each driver is provided with 13 sets of dry weather tyres four sets of intermediates and three sets of wet tyres across a race weekend

Hembery said You d have people who maybe need to risk more taking decisions that would create a safety problem 
You have to take into account some of the extreme conditions and it might mean someone making a choice we would not feel is correct 
Hembery also claimed costs would triple with the suggested change 
He said There is a logistical problem the impossibility to sea freight you d have to start air freighting 
Force India deputy team principal Bob Fernley told BBC Sport he would like to see the system introduced for the Belgian Grand Prix at the end of August Other senior insiders say it could be applied from the start of next season 
Either is possible as it would require only a tweak to the sporting regulations which does not need unanimity among the teams 
Force India have scored 11 points in this season s championship the third lowest total
