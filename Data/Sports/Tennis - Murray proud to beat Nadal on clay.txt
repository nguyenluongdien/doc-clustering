Andy Murray claimed his first victory over Rafael Nadal on clay to win the Madrid Masters on Sunday evening 
The Briton had never beaten Nadal in six previous meetings on the surface but won 6 3 6 2 to stun the home crowd 
Defending champion Nadal was aiming for a record fifth win in Madrid but Murray outclassed his Spanish opponent to lift his first Masters title on clay 
It s one of the hardest things in tennis to try and win against Rafa on clay so I m glad I ve managed to do it Murray told Sky Sports 
I made very few errors and changed the height of the ball extremely well which was part of the reason why he was mistiming a few shots 
Murray appeared to play with his wedding ring attached to his shoe
