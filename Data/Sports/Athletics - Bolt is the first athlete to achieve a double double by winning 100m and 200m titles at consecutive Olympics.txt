Usain Bolt has no problem competing against Justin Gatlin because he feels that the four year doping ban the American served was a fair suspension 
The ban Tyson got was unfair and sent the wrong message said Bolt 
The Jamaican sprinter will come up against both men this weekend in the 4x100m at the World Relays Championships in the Bahamas 
Bolt had said he was not looking forward to competing against Gay who was initially given a two year ban in 2014 before having the punishment halved and backdated after co operating with US doping authorities 
Justin Gatlin is a great competitor He s one of those guys who talks a lot and says a lot said Bolt 
So for me he makes the sport interesting and I look forward to running against him this season 
Bolt recently announced that he intends to retire from athletics after the 2017 World Championships
