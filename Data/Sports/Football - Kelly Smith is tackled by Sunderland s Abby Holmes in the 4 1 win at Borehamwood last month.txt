Arsenal Ladies striker Kelly Smith says the Sunderland player who left her needing ankle surgery is not good enough to play in Women s Super League One 
Smith 36 is regarded as England s best ever player and recently retired from international duty 
I m absolutely furious and I can t get that tackle out of my head she said 
While she gets a three match ban I in effect get a 15 game ban in the league as well as cup games 
She s clearly not good enough to be playing at this level 
The Arsenal player coach added Those type of tackles end careers 
Smith who is England s record scorer with 46 goals in 117 games has has had an injury hit career where time out from the game has previously led to struggles with alcoholism 
Kelly Smith is tackled by Sunderland s Abby Holmes in the 4 1 win at Borehamwood last month
