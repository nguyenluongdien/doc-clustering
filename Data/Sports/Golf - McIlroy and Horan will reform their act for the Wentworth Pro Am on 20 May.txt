One Direction star Niall Horan will play alongside world number one Rory McIlroy at the BMW PGA Championship Pro Am later this month 
They will pair up again at Wentworth playing alongside ex footballers Phil Neville and Paul Scholes 
I ll probably be more nervous than in front of thousands with 1D said 21 year old Horan 
I m hoping Rory will give me a few tips on calming the nerves 
Horan one quarter of the world s most famous band at present caused a stir at the usually reserved Augusta National Golf Club during the traditional par three event last month 
The singer signed autographs for fans played a tee shot that landed in the water and then tripped over before a television interview while carrying McIlroy s bag 
Niall and I had a good fun together in the par three contest at the Masters and I m looking forward to seeing him again at Wentworth McIlroy said
