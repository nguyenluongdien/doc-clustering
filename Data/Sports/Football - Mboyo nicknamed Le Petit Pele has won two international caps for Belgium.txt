Mboyo 28 spent time in prison in Belgium for participating in the gang rape of a 14 year old girl in 2004 
He is absolutely not on our radar He is not a player we are interested in signing said a Charlton spokesman 
Mboyo who scored eight goals in 19 league games for Genk this season was 17 at the time of his crime and was subsequently sentenced to seven years in jail 
He was spotted by a football scout during a training session at a Belgian prison which was being held as part of the Football in Prison scheme which had been started in 1995 by Princess Paola now Queen Paola of Belgium 
Mboyo was allowed to train with Charleroi after approval from the Belgian courts and the DR Congo born player then signed a professional contract in 2009 
He subsequently moved on to Kortrijk and Gent before joining Genk in 2013 for a fee of 3 5m 
A petition calling for Charlton not to sign Mboyo had been launched by Twitter user Jean Hatchet before the Addicks moved to distance themselves from a move for the striker
