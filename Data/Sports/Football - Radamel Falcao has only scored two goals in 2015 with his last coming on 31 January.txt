Radamel Falcao s mother has said the striker is unhappy at Manchester United and could leave in the summer 
Falcao 29 has only started one of United s last eight Premier League matches the 1 0 loss at Chelsea 
I often remind him that after a test or a difficulty blessings arrive If God shows him a new path he ll leave Manchester if not he ll stay We hope for bigger and better things 
God hasn t abandoned us and my son will become again what he has been a goal scorer 
Before his move to Old Trafford Falcao was one of the most prolific strikers in the world with 104 goals in 139 games for Porto Atletico Madrid and Monaco 
However Falcao who earns approximately 265 000 a week at United has not scored since his goal against Leicester City on 31 January 
Ms Zarate added It s not a normal situation given what he has experienced in his career but it happens in football 
Not everything has been easy in Falcao s life He has had some difficult moments in his career 
They slowed his progress and prevented him from participating in important competitions like the World Cup or have confined him to the bench like in Manchester
