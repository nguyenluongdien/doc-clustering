McLaren have unveiled the first fundamentally new colour scheme on their Formula 1 car for 18 years 
The team have ditched the predominantly silver livery they have sported since 1997 in favour of graphite grey with day glo orange highlights 
It is only the second major change of colour scheme for the team since 1974 
A spokesman described the new design as a dynamic predatory graphite grey colouration complemented by McLaren day glow speedmarks and key lines 
He added that the idea was to optimise the car not only for bright sunshine but also for floodlights used in twilight and night races 
McLaren chairman Ron Dennis hinted at a change of livery during pre season testing
