Whether they are individual or collective Nadine Kessler has already garnered an impressive array of awards 
The 27 year old German midfielder won the women s Champions League with Turbine Pottsdam in 2010 before moving to Wolfsburg in 2011 and as captain led them to unprecedented successive Champions League and Bundesliga title triumphs 
Last season Wolfsburg also added the German Cup becoming the second team to win the treble 
Kessler has represented her country at every level from the Under 15s upwards and has scored 10 goals in 29 games for the senior team 
She was part of the team that won the 2013 European Championship a sixth consecutive title for Germany 
Despite a career which has been interspersed with injuries the only prize missing from her trophy cabinet is the World Cup 
But after a knee operation in March there are question marks over her fitness before this year s tournament in Canada 
Following her nomination Kessler said I am very honoured to be nominated for the BBC Women s Footballer of the Year Award 
It is a special award because this time the fans are given the opportunity to vote for the players 
For us football players the support of our fans is extremely important That s why in Germany we call them the 12th person on the field 
Kessler is battling with a knee injury in the build up to the World Cup
