Kevin Pietersen has been misled by the England and Wales Cricket Board according to former England captain Michael Vaughan 
Pietersen will not be considered for England this summer two months after incoming ECB chairman Colin Graves suggested a return was possible 
He s been misled and mistreated Vaughan told BBC Sport 
He s done everything that was asked of him but taken down a path that was a dead end 
Strauss says there is no trust from ECB 
Pietersen was told his international career was over in February 2014 only for Graves to suggest the 34 year old could add to his 104 England caps if he joined a county and scored enough runs to merit a recall 
As a result the right hander pulled out of a deal with Indian Premier League team Sunrisers Hyderabad and signed for Surrey 
Surrey director of cricket Alec Stewart another former England captain said He probably feels a little bit let down after Colin Graves comments where it was if you play county cricket if you score runs the slate s been wiped clean you will be considered 
He s given up a contract to play in the Indian Premier League he s done what s been asked of him and now the door has been shut He s given up a quarter of a million pounds on the back of Colin Graves comments 
That word trust may be a two way thing 
Kevin Pietersen s England highs lows 
Despite telling Pietersen he is surplus to requirements Strauss did offer him a job of consultant to the limited overs teams one which was turned down 
It s absurd because you can t say I don t trust you to play in the side but can I pick your brains for the one day game said Vaughan Strauss will probably have to answer many questions about that 
I hope somewhere down the line Kevin can be used because he has a good cricket brain 
However Vaughan did say he believes Strauss is a good appointment as director of cricket a new post created following the departure of managing director Paul Downton 
As well as ruling on Pietersen s future Strauss who twice captained England to Ashes success has also sacked coach Peter Moores 
Strauss is a good appointment the right man for the right role said Vaughan 
He s got tough decisions to make and has made one already to get rid of Moores That was the right decision for the England team
