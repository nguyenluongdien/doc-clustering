Wasps scrum half Joe Simpson will miss the Premiership season finale after straining a ligament in his left knee against Leicester Tigers 
The 26 year old does not require surgery but will be unable to play for between six and eight weeks 
Simpson who won an England cap against Georgia in 2011 has played 28 games this season scoring seven tries 
Sixth placed Wasps require at least a point from their trip to London Irish to guarantee European rugby next term 
Simpson was injured in a heavy challenge from Leicester s Vereniki Goneva early in the second half of last Saturday s game which Wasps lost 26 21 
Whether it was late or not I don t know But it wasn t given so I guess not said Wasps director of rugby Dai Young afterwards 
Losing any of your quality players is always a bit of a blow He brings a lot to us but Charlie Davies came on and certainly did not let us down 
He s a different kind of scrum half and got us moving quite well
