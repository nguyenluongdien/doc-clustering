England have not made an approach to appoint Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie as Peter Moores successor insists the county s chief Martyn Moxon 
At the moment it is purely what Andrew said and nothing more said Moxon 55 It is all speculation 
But he admits Gillespie 40 will take an international job in the future 
As far as an international coaching career is concerned it will be when rather than if said Moxon 
Jason is a very talented coach he has got fantastic playing experience he has a great rapport with the lads and is a great communicator 
Gillespie right and director of cricket Moxon led Yorkshire to a record 31st outright County Championship
