Northampton full back Ahsee Tuala has signed a new deal while Scarlets back row Sion Bennett and Sale scrum half Alex Mitchell have agreed to join the Premiership leaders from next season 
Samoa international Tuala 25 joined Saints on a contract to the end of the season in February and has scored four tries in his eight appearances 
Wales Under 20 man Bennett 21 has played eight times for Scarlets 
And Mitchell 17 has seven caps for England Under 18s 
He has worked hard on every aspect of his game and has settled in very well with the rest of the squad 
Of the youngsters he added We ve got a lot of talented youngsters coming through our own academy system but we always have an eye on what is happening elsewhere and Sion and Alex are two very good players who we believe have a lot of potential to impress in the years to come
