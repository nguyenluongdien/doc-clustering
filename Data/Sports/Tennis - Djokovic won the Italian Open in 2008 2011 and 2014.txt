Defending champion Novak Djokovic returned to action after a three week break with victory over Spain s Nicolas Almagro at the Italian Open 
Djokovic 27 will next face another Spaniard Roberto Bautista Agut 
My preparations started a little bit later this year than in previous ones I have to take my time and get into a groove it s been a while since I ve played that many matches within a span of six days 
The Spaniard made him work hard for it reeling off five points in a row to take the second set tie break and holding firm in the decider until the seventh game 
Djokovic finally got the break when Almagro netted and the Serb converted his second match point to reach round three 
In the important moments today I did feel a little uncomfortable Maybe that s from lack of playing Djokovic said I m sure I ll be back on track in no time
