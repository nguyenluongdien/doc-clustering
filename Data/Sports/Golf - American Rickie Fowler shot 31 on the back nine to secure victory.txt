American Rickie Fowler beat Sergio Garcia and Kevin Kisner in a play off on a dramatic final day at the Players Championship at Sawgrass 
The trio finished on 12 under but Fowler beat Kisner at the first sudden death hole after Garcia was earlier eliminated 
I felt really good all week this is special said the 26 year old 
In the first three hole aggregate play off in tournament history Garcia could only play the 16th 17th and 18th in level par as Fowler and Kisner played them in one under thanks to birdies on the 17th 
And Fowler then repeated the trick on the first hole of sudden death to give him a prize of 1 8m 1 16m in the tournament often dubbed as golf s richest event 
I laughed at the poll but I was always looked at as only having one win on tour and I always felt that I needed to put myself in position to win more often he added 
I look at this event as basically like a major It has the major feel obviously one of the best fields we play all year on a tough golf course 
This will definitely give me momentum going into the US Open 18 21 June and makes me feel confident about being in this situation and taking care of business 
Fowler who started his round three shots behind leader Chris Kirk was one over after 10 holes and seemingly out of contention 
But he shot four birdies and an eagle in his final six holes and looked on course for victory but Garcia and Kisner both birdied the 16th and 17th to force a play off 
Garcia had been aiming for a first PGA Tour win since claiming victory at the Wyndham Championship in North Carolina in August 2012
