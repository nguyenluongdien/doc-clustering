Jessica Ennis Hill will only return to heptathlon action in Gotzis if she is fully ready according to her coach 
Ennis Hill had planned to compete in the Gotzis Hypo Meeting in Austria on 30 31 May 
But coach Toni Minichiello said she had a bit of work to do before a decision would be made 
Ennis Hill had been out for almost two years after giving birth to son Reggie last July 
It would also be Ennis Hill s first chance to reach the qualifying mark of 6 200 points for the Rio 2016 Olympics 
Minichiello said I need to put another couple of weeks of training in to know where we are in other events and see some other indicators in training that say it s worth going 
Are we just going there for the sake of going or are we going there to produce a performance that has an Olympic qualifying score 
Are we ready to participate in that kind of competition If we re ready then fine There are three or four different options after Gotzis so there is a lot of time 
Britain s Katarina Johnson Thompson 22 is the defending champion in Gotzis and British Athletics performance director Neil Black has described the prospective meeting in Austria between the Liverpudlian and Ennis Hill as spectacular
