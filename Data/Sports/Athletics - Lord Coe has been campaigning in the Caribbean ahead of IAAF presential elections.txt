World Athletics presidential candidate Lord Coe says staging the World Championships in Africa has to be a high priority 
Africa is the only continent not to have staged either an athletics World Championships or an Olympic Games 
Clearly if we are a truly global sport the World Championships has to go to Africa and it has to be a high priority Coe told BBC Sport 
The contribution by African middle and long distance runners to athletics has been immense and we need to recognise that he added 
However although Coe is eager to see an African country stage the championships he feels it must be under the correct conditions in order to provide a lasting legacy 
It s very important you don t just put a World Championships in to a continent without the strength and the marketing and all the culture and education in the lead up to it said Coe 
Then once the Championships have arrived and have delivered you also have to have systems in place post championships so that they don t just sort of fall off the cliffside as they have in the past in many continents 
So it s really important that we do get the World Championships there but that we sit down and figure out how we can best make them work not just for African athletics but for global athletics 
It is the second time in as many weeks he has visited the the Caribbean region as he campaigns internationally for the IAAF presidential election at the World Championships in Beijing in August 
One of the main talking points in the lead up to this athletics season has been doping with Russia facing accusations of widespread wrongdoing in a German television documentary 
And recently 100m world record holder Usain Bolt said that American rival Tyson Gay should have been banned for life in his doping case rather than given a one year punishment 
Usain Bolt has said rival Tyson Gay should have a life ban for doping offences
