They may have drawn the series but it feels like a series loss England dominated the three Test matches more than West Indies and they had chances to snuff the hosts out but they didn t take them 
In this match England were guilty of not scoring enough runs in the first innings after winning the toss making an awful mess of their second innings with only three batsmen reaching double figures and then failing to put the West Indian batsmen under pressure with their spin bowlers on a turning pitch 
The players have to take responsibility for these failings It s all very well blaming coach Peter Moores as many people will do but I know from my own experience that as a professional sportsman you have to take responsibility for your own performance 
However that s not to say that Moores doesn t have questions to answer In my opinion he and captain Alastair Cook have consistently got the selection wrong on this tour 
We have a cautious captain and coach they are not going to change They don t have any imagination If Andrew Strauss is the new ECB director it will stay the same He likes Cook We ll keep on with the same people and things won t change 
In game after game they have played safe and if you keep playing safe eventually you are going to get caught out 
They need to be more enterprising They were wrong to stick with the same uninspiring bowling attack they should have added a bit of variety either through the express pace of Liam Plunkett or the leg spin of Adil Rashid 
That should be it for now If he ever comes back he s got to play a lot of county cricket and prove he s playing great because what he s dished up in this series isn t good enough to carry on 
Are England improving under Moores That s a hard question to answer but if you look at the players on an individual basis you would have to say many of them are getting better 
Adil Rashid has played five ODIs but is yet to be selected for the Test side
