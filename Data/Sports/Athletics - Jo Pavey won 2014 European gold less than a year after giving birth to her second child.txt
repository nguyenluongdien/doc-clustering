European 10 000m gold medallist Jo Pavey will miss the World Championships in Beijing this August to aid her preparation for the 2016 Rio Olympics 
I feel this is not a good balance for my kids so I am going to stay at home 
I am also aware I need to look after myself if I want to qualify for Rio 
Also I am aware that conditions in Beijing might be hot humid and potentially have high pollution levels 
British Athletics performance director Neil Black said We are fully supportive of Jo s wishes not to be considered for selection for the World Championships in Beijing 
With a young family and the pressures that come with maintaining that professional and personal life balance we look forward to seeing her on the domestic and Diamond League circuit this summer
