Petra Kvitova blended power and precision to crush Svetlana Kuznetsova 6 1 6 2 in the Madrid Masters final 
Kuznetsova 29 took a medical timeout between sets and had no answer to Kvitova s ferocious hitting 
I feel very happy said Wimbledon champion Kvitova I m really glad that I won for the second time here 
The world number four raced through the first set in less than half an hour with heavy serving and returns frequently beyond Kuznetsova s reach 
Kuznetsova returned for the second set with her left thigh heavily strapped and immediately dropped serve 
Kvitova broke again for 3 0 and though her opponent held serve in games five and seven there was no way back
