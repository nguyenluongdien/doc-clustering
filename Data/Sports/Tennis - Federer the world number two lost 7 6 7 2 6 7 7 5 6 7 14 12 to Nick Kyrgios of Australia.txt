Top seed Roger Federer lost in the second round of the Madrid Open to 20 year old Australian Nick Kyrgios 
The Swiss world number two a three time winner of the tournament was beaten 7 6 7 2 6 7 7 5 6 7 14 12 
Federer 33 took the first set on a tie break but it is the big serving Kyrgios who will now play John Isner 
Third seed Rafael Nadal looking for a fifth Madrid title in his home country beat American Steve Johnson 6 4 6 3 and will play Italy s Simone Bolelli 
My problem was I couldn t return his first serve said Federer who won only 18 of 85 first serve return points It was just a horrible performance on the return That s what cost me the match
