Jenson Button said his McLaren was scary to drive and does not expect to score a point in 2015 
The 2009 world champion finished 16th at the Spanish Grand Prix ahead only of the back of the grid Manor cars 
The first 30 laps were the scariest of my life Button said 
Every time I touched the throttle at any speed the rear was just gone It wasn t normal In low speed corners it was just slow but high speed very scary 
Button could only finish in 16th place while his team mate Fernando Alonso was forced to retire
