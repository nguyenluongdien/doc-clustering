British Athletics performance director Neil Black has defended the sprinters who did not compete at the IAAF World Relays in the Bahamas at the weekend 
Among those missing were Adam Gemili James Dasaolu and Chijindu Ujah 
Black said That one event will be forgotten in a few weeks time and there s loads of time to qualify 
Britain came ninth in the heats in Nassau narrowly missing the A final and an early shot at Rio qualification 
World indoor 60m champion Kilty said the team would have challenged for gold had Britain taken their best team to the Bahamas 
The reasons given for Britain s best sprinters skipping the trip ranged from minor injuries to permitted absence due to university exams and summer outdoor plans 
Black added Our focus is towards the World Championships in Beijing it s towards the Olympics in Rio 
With particular reference to Adam absent to focus on university exams and James they are on the world class performance programme as individual athletes and as a result we allow them a degree of preference and planning to their individual programme
