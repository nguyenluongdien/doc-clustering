Kevin Pietersen will not play for England this summer after director of cricket Andrew Strauss said there was a massive trust issue between the two 
But in a 40 minute meeting with Strauss on Monday he was told he would not be considered until after the summer s home Ashes series against Australia 
The 34 year old was sacked by England in February 2014 but is playing county cricket in a bid to return to the Test team 
Now is the time for us to be really open about the Kevin Pietersen situation people have been running away from it for years said Strauss 
The truth about Kevin is that he is a phenomenal cricketer But over months and years trust has eroded between Kevin Pietersen and the ECB 
There is a massive trust issue between me and Kevin 
While there is no trust between Kevin and the ECB it is our opinion he cannot feature in our short term plans Long term who knows 
Speaking on Monday before his meeting with Strauss Pietersen said he was desperate to return to the international game adding Personal differences have got nothing to do with what the public wants The public just wants to see the England team winning 
What more can I do All I can do is score runs I m incredibly proud of how I played under pressure 
But Strauss s assertion that the South Africa born batsman will not be considered for selection could signal the end of a career that took in 8 181 runs and 23 centuries in 104 Tests 
Pietersen last played for England in the final Test of a 5 0 Ashes series defeat in Australia in January 2014 
He was sacked a month later and released an autobiography in October criticising several players saying there was a bullying culture in the squad 
In July 2014 Strauss apologised for making an offensive remark about his former team mate during a live television broadcast 
Andrew Strauss offered Pietersen a role as an advisor on a board to improve the one day side which was turned down 
He said Kevin has got brilliant experience in one day cricket and I think it would be madness not to try to get that information out of his head and help us form a strategy for English cricket going forwards 
That s why I asked him to be on that board Ultimately that may be an opportunity for us to start rebuilding trust 
It was Moores second spell in charge of the team which finished with a dismal World Cup performance and a drawn Test series in the West Indies 
That was a very tough decision to take Strauss told BBC Sport He s a very popular coach and has got some really strong attributes as a coach 
I personally think he s got some limitations in the international arena around strategy and tactics and I think we saw that in the World Cup to a certain extent 
But he was undermined greatly by the fact he had done the job before He needed time and space to take the England cricket team forward and he was never going to get that 
Former Australia seamer Jason Gillespie 40 is the current Yorkshire head coach and led the club from Division Two to the County Championship title within three years 
Strauss confirmed he is one of the candidates to replace Moores and said he wants someone in place in time for the Ashes which begin in July 
It is one of the top two coaching jobs in world cricket and there are a lot of ambitious coaches who want to prove they can cut the mustard at this level 
Strauss said Alastair Cook would remain as captain for the summer with Joe Root stepping up to vice captain and Eoin Morgan remaining in charge of the one day side 
Alastair Cook has my full backing to lead the side into the Ashes this summer He has had a brutally tough last 18 months with his own form and one day captaincy 
Selection is something we need to look at There have been times where there are issues around responsibility and accountability I want to look at that this summer 
Strauss said he would not play a tracksuit role instead leaving the coaching of the side to Moores replacement 
He added that it would be his job to make sure we are not off pace for the next World Cup 
I am not going to be in the dressing room That is not my role The captain and the coach will be in control 
ECB chief executive Tom Harrison echoed Strauss s opinion on Pietersen 
All I can add to what Andrew said is that we are aligned on the decision myself Andrew and Colin Graves 
It has been a tricky issue that has been interpreted in different ways by different people 
We are taking this as a chance to move forward with a new leadership with a real excitement about where English cricket can go 
Andrew mentions the word trust and I think that can work both ways There were reports in the papers after their meeting on Monday and that can only have come from one place 
On Andrew Strauss Do you want someone to be interesting or good at their job There s a massive misconception that the way to connect with the cricket public is by saying a lot
