The chances of having a heart attack stroke or dying young may be hidden in the palm of the hand a study suggests 
The international research team said it would be a simple inexpensive tool for doctors 
Experts argued the link between grip and the heart was unclear and needed more study 
The maximum crushing force you can exert in your grip naturally declines with age 
But those whose grip strength declines fastest may be at greater risk of health problems the study suggests 
The huge trial in 14 countries showed each 11lb 5kg reduction in grip strength increased the odds of an early death by 16 
The odds of a fatal heart problem increased by 17 and a stroke by 9 
The researchers argue grip strength makes more accurate predictions than blood pressure alone and could be a new tool for assessing risk 
Dr Darryl Leong one of the researchers at McMaster University in Canada said Grip strength could be an easy and inexpensive test to assess an individual s risk of death and cardiovascular disease 
Further research is needed to establish whether efforts to improve muscle strength are likely to reduce an individual s risk of death and cardiovascular disease 
It is still unknown why worsening heart health could manifest as a weaker grip 
Suggestions included hardening arteries reducing muscle strength 
Doireann Maddock from the British Heart Foundation said The findings of this study are interesting However it doesn t explain why grip strength should be related to cardiovascular disease 
More research is needed to understand any possible link between the two 
The good news is we already know there are several established risk factors for cardiovascular disease and an NHS health check can assess your risk
