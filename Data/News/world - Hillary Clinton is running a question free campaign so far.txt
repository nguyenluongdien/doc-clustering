There s a growing chorus of complaints that Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton is dodging tough questions from reporters during the early days of her presidential campaign 
It s a criticism that conservative commentators and political operatives largely started but is increasingly being picked up by mainstream journalists 
Among the not so hard hitting interrogatories the former secretary of state has answered 
Variations on how she likes Iowa Answer It s fabulous 
Is Iowa important Yes 
Why are you running for president To be the champion of Americans and their families 
Not asked was what kind of tree she would be if she liked puppies or who she thinks will win the Stanley Cup 
There were a handful of more challenging queries on issues such as international trade allegations of ethical improprieties from the book Clinton Cash and a telling sign of journalistic frustration whether she thinks her campaign is too staged Mrs Clinton quickly brushed them off 
Why Mrs Clinton has decided not to answer questions for the simple reason that she doesn t have to And all the grousing from the media whose public approval ratings rank even lower than those of politicians likely isn t going to change that 
Mrs Clinton almost certainly won t face a serious challenger for the Democratic nomination and so she is in effect already running a general election campaign And like most general election campaigns the events are carefully scripted and the interaction with the public is meticulously controlled in order to avoid any potentially damaging missteps 
Those town hall forums Packed with supporters The kitchen table conversations Staged photo ops If an errant challenging question or moment of candour slips through it represents a failure on the part of the candidate s advance team 
Ms Fiorina and the rest of the current crop of Republican presidential hopefuls don t have that luxury however They re competing for attention and political oxygen in a crowded field where it s difficult to turn down the free media hits that accompany unscripted interviews and face to face voter interaction 
Unlike Mrs Clinton Republican candidates are going to have to work against fierce opposition to garner supporters in the early voting states where residents pride themselves on being able to have meaningful interactions with the candidates 
New Hampshire and Iowa voters will certainly get to meet Mrs Clinton over the coming months And campaign spokesperson Jesse Ferguson points out that Mrs Clinton is answering their questions which are the ones that count 
But unless something changes those interactions are all going to be in a much more comfortable environment than Republican candidates could hope for 
And reporters are largely going to have to keep their questions to themselves 
Republican candidates in and out of the race
