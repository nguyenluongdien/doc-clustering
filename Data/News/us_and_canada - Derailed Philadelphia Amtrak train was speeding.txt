An Amtrak train that derailed in Philadelphia killing at least seven people was travelling at twice the speed limit say safety experts 
The driver applied the emergency brakes when the train hit 106mph 170km h on a 50mph track said the National Transportation Safety Board NTSB 
But his efforts had only brought the speed down to 102mph when the deadly crash happened 
He has been identified in US media as 32 year old Brandon Bostian 
He remembers going to that area generally but has absolutely no recollection of the incident or anything unusual his attorney Robert Goggin told ABC 
Robert Sumwalt of the NTSB told reporters a speed control system had not yet been installed in that area unlike other parts of the route along Amtrak s Northeast Corridor 
We feel that had such a system been installed in this section of track this accident would not have occurred he said 
Amtrak Train 188 was going from Washington to New York when it derailed on Tuesday night leaving more 200 people injured 
The death toll rose from six to seven on Wednesday as another body was found by the search and rescue team 
Five victims have been publicly identified so far 
One man has been confirmed missing 
Robert Gildersleeve an executive with a chemical company had dropped off his son at lacrosse practice before boarding the train 
One of the busiest stretches of passenger rail in the country between Philadelphia and New York is closed as officials continue to try to establish exactly what happened 
President Obama said he was shocked and deeply saddened to hear of the derailment 
As emergency crews continued to dig through the wreckage lawmakers in Washington debated the future of Amtrak s budget with one spending committee voting to slash their funding by almost a fifth 
We are divesting from America accused one member of Congress 
Don t use this tragedy in that way another Congressman responded angrily 
Congress has only 18 more days before federal funding for transportation infrastructure expires but the funding is likely to be temporarily extended 
Amtrak is a national publicly funded rail service serving tens of millions of people every year 
The crash happened not far from the site of a derailment in 1943 that killed 79 people one of the worst train accidents in the US 
A train travelling at almost twice the speed limit crashed in Spain in 2013 also killing 79 people
