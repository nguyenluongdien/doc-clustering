Former Guatemalan police chief Erwin Sperisen has lost an appeal in a Swiss court against a life sentence for killing prisoners in his home country 
Last year Sperisen who also has Swiss nationality was convicted over the execution of seven prisoners in a jail near Guatemala City in September 2006 
The court heard that he had shot dead one of the prisoners himself 
He was also found guilty of the murder of three prisoners who had escaped from another jail the year before 
His paternal grandfather was a Swiss migrant to Guatemala giving him the right to Swiss citizenship 
The 44 year old was tried in Geneva under a law allowing Swiss nationals to be tried in their own country for crimes committed abroad 
His arrest in 2012 followed an investigation by the UN backed international commission against impunity in Guatemala 
The case was launched after a lawsuit filed by the mother of one of Erwin Sperisen s victims
