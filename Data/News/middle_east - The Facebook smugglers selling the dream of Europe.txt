Across the Mediterranean people smugglers are advertising their services on Facebook promising safe passage to migrants desperate to reach Europe Their pages offer a glimpse into a smuggling network that spans three continents generates hundreds of millions of dollars and has become in effect an alternative asylum service for the EU 
With the beginning of the new season we have a range of journeys on offer Turkey Libya Italy 3 800 Algeria Libya Italy 2 500 Sudan Libya Italy 2 500 The boats are all wood If you have questions contact me on Viber or WhatsApp 
This is not an ad from a travel brochure It s a Facebook update posted by a people smuggler Abdul Aziz from the Libyan port of Zuwara on 21 April Abdul Aziz is just one of hundreds of smugglers now using social media to promote their services to migrants and refugees trying to reach Europe 
Their pages advertise everything from fake documents to safe passage by land air or sea Many are illustrated with photos of luxury cruise liners or crisp new passports and include package deals Kids go free is a popular offer as well as glowing testimonies that purport to be from migrants who have made the journey 
But behind the glib promises and the slick online communications is a ruthless real world web of smugglers and con men who thrive on the vulnerability of the migrants 
This web extends not only across the Mediterranean and the Middle East but deep into sub Saharan Africa Abdul Aziz alone claims to have agents in almost every Arab state and says if people can t get here to Libya I have legal and illegal ways to get them into the country 
The network that links a boat runner like Abdul Aziz to a passport forger in Istanbul or a truck driver in Eritrea is an underground ever shifting configuration of personal contacts criminal gangs and one off business deals that runs across national borders and is almost impossible to police 
The adaptability of this system only makes it more efficient last year some 220 000 migrants crossed the Mediterranean most leaving Libya in smugglers boats before being rescued at sea by the Italian coastguard or navy Since the start of 2015 another 35 000 have reached Italy More than 1 800 have drowned in the attempt 
There is nothing new in this African migrants have been sailing from Zuwara for at least 30 years But the proliferation of Arabic language smuggling pages on Facebook reflects a surge in demand from Syrian and other Arab migrants since the uprisings of 2011 as well as a growing confidence among the smugglers themselves many of whom post their mobile phone numbers online or field enquiries via online messaging apps 
Abdul Aziz who spoke to the BBC via Skype said that between 10 and 20 people contact him through his Facebook page every day Until 2012 we didn t use social media at all he said Now it accounts for between 30 and 40 of my business 
The collapse of the Libyan state has also emboldened the smugglers allowing them to promote themselves online without fear of arrest Abdul Aziz laughed at the suggestion that his Facebook page might attract the attention of the authorities What authorities There aren t any authorities There isn t even a regime There s nothing 
Giampaolo Musumeci an Italian journalist who has written a book about North Africa s smuggling gangs sees their growing social media presence as part of the marketing operation for the biggest illegal travel company in the world 
According to Musumeci this company made something between 300m and 600m euros 235m 470m 215m 430m last year from those trying to get into Europe and now constitutes an unofficial asylum service for people whose lives have been derailed by poverty chaos and war 
What I m selling a Pakistani smuggler in Italy told Musumeci is the dream of Europe 
For many of those who arrived in the EU last year it s a dream that could not be realized through legal channels 
Take Ayham al Faris a Syrian translator and anti Assad campaigner who fled his country in fear for his life in October 2011 Before he left Ayham tried to apply for a visa from the French and Austrian embassies in Damascus He got nowhere Later after he had reached Turkey Ayham approached the German Australian and Bosnian embassies with the same request They didn t even say We don t have programmes for you we can t give you a visa now or something like that They just say Send us an email but when I send them my email they just throw it away 
Faced with this wall of bureaucratic indifference Ayham made his own way into Greece where he used Facebook to contact a Syrian smuggler called Hafez He said he can take me wherever I want no problem it s easy for him The most important thing is that you have your money in your pocket 
Despite the sales patter Hafez failed to get Ayham out of Greece Eventually Ayham bought a fake passport from another smuggler and at the 11th attempt got on a flight to Paris He has now been granted asylum in the Netherlands 
It s a case that illustrates the crux of the problem people smugglers are responding to a demand for asylum that Europe s politicians are unwilling to meet As long as this situation persists says Musumeci the smugglers will always find a way into the fortress 
They re thinking about how to get into Europe 24 hours a day They communicate They stay in touch They change routes one of these guys told me We study Europe we study the laws and the more you close the borders the more money we re going to make 
New EU proposals to distribute migrants across member states and break up clandestine networks might help to reduce people smuggling within Europe But Musumeci says it will do nothing to stop the boats coming across the Mediterranean Dealing with that he argues will require a whole new level of engagement with the political turmoil in parts of Africa and the Middle East 
Migration is going to force us to deal with these international issues We need to focus on Libya Eritrea Somalia Syria It may sound naive but it s the only way to stop the influx We ll never stop this just by closing the doors I ve talked to dozens of migrants and these people are willing to die to get into Europe 
Despite the obvious difficulties European countries are still trying to solve the problem at the level of policing Europol the EU s law enforcement agency recently launched an intelligence program JOT Mare which is supposed to disrupt or dismantle the smuggling networks that are bringing so many migrants across the Mediterranean 
A spokesperson for Europol confirmed that their agents will look at the online presence of the smugglers JOT Mare is focussing on all modi operandi used by facilitators of irregular migration in the Mediterranean Sea including the use of social media 
He conceded though that Europol has no operational cooperation agreement with Libya the point of departure for the vast majority of migrants 
In Zuwara Abdul Aziz hadn t heard of JOT Mare but didn t sound too worried It s just words on paper I m not afraid because it s meaningless How are they going to follow me Are they going to come to Libya If they try it would be considered an invasion Are they going to catch me outside Libya I don t go outside Libya And if I do go they won t know about it
