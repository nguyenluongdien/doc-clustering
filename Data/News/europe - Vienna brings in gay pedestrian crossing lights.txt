Dozens of traffic lights in the Austrian capital have been changed to show gay couples crossing the road instead of the traditional lone figure 
Vienna has changed the signal images at 120 pedestrian crossings also showing heterosexual couples in preparation for the Eurovision Song Contest 
Officials said the signals were a sign of Vienna s open mindedness 
Toni Mahdalik of the right wing Freedom Party of Austria called the initiative gender politics gone mad 
He said the money would have been better spent on reducing poverty and improving unemployment figures 
It is hoped the signals which show couples holding hands and with love hearts above them instead of a gender neutral figure will also improve safety 
The unusual symbols are attracting the attention of drivers and pedestrians a spokeswoman for Vienna s city lighting department said 
About 40 countries are taking part in the 2015 Eurovision contest The final will be held on May 23
