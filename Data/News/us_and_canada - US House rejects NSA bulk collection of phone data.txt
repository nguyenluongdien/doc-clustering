The US House of Representatives has voted to end the National Security Agency s bulk collection of Americans phone records 
A 338 to 88 overwhelming vote in favour of the USA Freedom Act already backed by the White House means Senate backing would make it law 
The bill would empower the agency to search data held by telephone companies on a case by case basis 
Bulk collection was revealed in 2013 by ex security contractor Edward Snowden 
Supporters of the Freedom Act including privacy and civil rights advocates say it protects privacy while preserving national security powers 
The bill which only affects people within the US would amend sections of the USA Patriot Act which was passed after the 9 11 attacks and which will expire on 1 June 
The amendments would ban the agency s mass collection of telephone data phone numbers time and duration of calls as well as emails and web addresses 
Americans liberty and America s security can co exist said House Judiciary Committee chairman Bob Goodlatte who voted in favour of the bill 
These fundamental concepts are not mutually exclusive 
Earlier this month a US appeals court ruled that bulk collection of phone records by the National Security Agency was illegal
