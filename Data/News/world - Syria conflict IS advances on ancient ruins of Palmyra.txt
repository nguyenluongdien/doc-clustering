Islamic State IS militants are reportedly mounting an assault on the Syrian town of Tadmur where Palmyra one of the greatest archaeological sites in the Middle East is located 
The IS advance has raised fears over what might happen to the temples and colonnaded streets of the ancient city if the jihadists take control of it 
They have ransacked and destroyed several ancient sites in Iraq 
Palmyra has already suffered some damage during the four year civil war 
The government controlled area is close to gas fields and lies on the road between the capital Damascus and the contested eastern city of Deir al Zour 
Syrian Observatory s director Rami Abdul Rahman told the AFP news agency that the jihadists had taken all the army posts between Tadmur and al Sukhanah a town to the north after a lightning advance across the desert 
IS itself claimed on Twitter that it had already taken control of northern and eastern parts of Tadmur and that it had shot down a Syrian air force MiG jet in the area 
On Wednesday a Homs based activist told the Associated Press that IS had seized a ammunition depot and had bombed Tadmur s airport 
Homs provincial governor Talal Barazi confirmed that al Sukhanah had fallen and said 1 800 families from the town were sheltering in Tadmur AFP reported 
The Syrian Observatory said more than 70 soldiers and 40 militants had been killed in the battle for al Sukhanah among them IS religious official Anas al Nashwan who appeared in a video last month showing the beheading of Ethiopian Christians in Libya 
Rising out of the desert and flanked by an oasis Palmyra contains the monumental ruins of a great city that was one of the most important cultural centres of the ancient world according to Unesco 
The site most of which dates back to the 1st to the 2nd Century AD when the region was under Roman rule is dominated by a grand colonnaded street 
At the southern end of the 1 1km street is the great temple of Baal considered one of the most important religious buildings of the 1st Century in the East and of unique design 
Syria s director of antiquities Maamoun Abdul Karim said he had no doubt that if Palmyra were to fall to IS it would suffer a similar fate to the ancient sites in northern Iraq recently blown up by the group 
If IS enters Palmyra it will spell its destruction he told AFP If the ancient city falls it will be an international catastrophe
