Rescue workers are trying to reach at least 15 miners trapped in a flooded gold mine in north western Colombia 
The mine collapsed apparently due to flooding caused by drilling holes to extract the mineral 
Officials said some of the miners were trapped at a depth of around 17 metres 55 feet 
They said it may take three days to pump out enough water to reach the men but the owner of the mine said they may already be dead 
Leonardo Mejia the mine owner told reporters that several miners had managed to escape when they realised something was wrong 
He said he feared the 15 missing miners were all dead 
The National Mining Agency ANM said local firefighters reported that gases in the deep vertical tunnels had contributed to the cave in 
Colombia is a major gold producer but more than half its mines are unregulated
