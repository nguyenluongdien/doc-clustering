Cricket Australia has confirmed it will commission an independent review into the death of batsman Phillip Hughes 
A Cricket Australia statement read We have a responsibility and obligation to look into the events of that day 
The statement added the review was not about blame but preventing an accident of this nature happening again 
Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland added When this tragedy happened I said that it was a freak accident but it was one freak accident too many 
How can cricket helmets be made safer 
Never again do we want to see something like that happen on a cricket field 
The review will be held with the support of Hughes s family and is expected to publish its findings later this year It will examine 
the causes and circumstances which led to Hughes s death 
what practices can be put in place to prevent a similar accident from occurring 
the use of personal protective equipment in order to protect the head and heart 
the medical screening of contracted players especially those players with particular vulnerabilities 
the medical support and coverage afforded to players and on field support staff including match officals at matches and training 
This is about trying to stop such a thing ever happening again and looking at protection in particular At the Word Cup Sri Lanka s Kumar Sangakkara tried out a clip on attachment to his helmet to add protection to the back of the neck The problem of course is that although you have to make sure people are as well protected as possible you do need freedom of movement as well Avoiding a short pitched ball is all part of the game so you can t hamper that 
Hughes who also played for Hampshire Middlesex and Worcestershire was hit by a delivery from bowler Sean Abbott 
Around 5 000 people attended the funeral in Hughes s home town of Macksville New South Wales with the service broadcast live to millions of people on Australian television
