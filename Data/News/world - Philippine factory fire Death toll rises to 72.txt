The death toll in a fire that destroyed a shoe factory in the Philippine capital has risen to 72 officials say 
Police have vowed to take swift action against those responsible amid workers claims of poor health and safety standards 
Definitely there will be charges here because people died acting national police chief Leonardo Espina said 
Police say the fire started when sparks from welding work ignited flammable chemicals near the building s entrance 
The Philippines has lax safety standards and large fires are relatively common particularly in slum areas 
Wednesday s fire spread quickly and a few people escaped Many more were trapped on the second floor of the building where according to survivors iron grills on windows prevented their escape 
Most of the victims are thought to have suffocated in thick black smoke from burning rubber and chemicals 
Regardless of whether it was an accident or arson people died We are just determining what exactly happened so that we can clearly define what charges to file Mr Espina told reporters on Thursday 
The owner of the factory which is operated by Kentex Manufacturing and produces rubber flip flops and sandals said about 200 to 300 people were inside the building at the time of the fire 
The mayor of the Valenzuela district Rexlon Gatchalian told the AFP news agency he did not expect the death toll to rise much further as the number of bodies retrieved matched the number of people missing 
Survivors and relatives of the victims told the news agency that factory employees worked for below minimum wage surrounded by chemicals and unaware of fire safety standards 
We were running not knowing exactly where to go one of the survivors Lisandro Mendoza said 
Some of those trapped texted family members asking for help local media reported 
The process of identifying the bodies will take time officials warn as fingerprints can no longer be used to identify the charred remains of the victims 
The factory is in the rundown district of Valenzuela in the north of the capital
