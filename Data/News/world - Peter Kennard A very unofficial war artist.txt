His art has been inspired by protest movements but Peter Kennard says his aim is not to create propaganda His eye catching work is now on show at the Imperial War Museum in London 
Best known for the distinctive photography montages from the early decades of his career Peter Kennard s later works have seen him try new techniques as technology advanced 
Kennard s Decoration series of giant paintings which combine digital prints worked over in oil were created as a direct response to the invasion of Iraq 
The two featured here show medals with ribbons made from ripped and frayed American flags 
The medals have been substituted One has become the helmet of an American soldier with the number of kills listed in groups of five 
A hooded man hanging beneath the clasp on another of the artworks aims to remind people of the prisoner abuse by US troops at Abu Ghraib jail 
As an artist Kennard says it is important for him to reflect current events rather than give people a history lesson 
His images have have inspired other artists from Mark Wallinger to Banksy 
More recently Kennard has blended statistics with his thought provoking montages to press home his message 
On this plate coins replace food as the numbers and wording reflect the number of people on the planet who lack the diet for a healthy life 
There is now much more of a social consciousness among artists says Kennard which wasn t there 50 years ago or even as recently as the 1990s 
He says there is a new generation that wants to use current events to make people think including global warming and human rights 
Kennard s last image shows Earth as a human head with missiles sticking out as hair and the torso of a starving child underneath 
That image is juxtaposed with a giant financial figure of more than 1 7 trillion claimed to be the total amount of money spent on global military expenditure in 2013 
Kennard says he is trying to make people think and show the stupidity and horror of the way the world is being run
