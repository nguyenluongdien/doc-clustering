A teenager has appeared in a court in Mexico saying she is Alondra Diaz Garcia the girl at the centre of a US Mexico custody battle 
Alondra Diaz Garcia was taken from Houston to Mexico by her father eight years ago after a US court awarded custody to the girl s mother 
Alondra s mother Dorotea Garcia has been searching for her since 
Last month another Mexican girl was mistaken for Alondra and taken against her will to Ms Garcia in the US 
The video showing the 14 year old girl called Alondra Luna Nunez in distress as she is seized by police and dragged away from her school caused outrage after it was published on social media 
Ms Garcia had mistaken her for her daughter because the two girls share the same first name are of a similar age and bear a similar scar 
Alondra Luna Nunez was sent to Houston where Ms Garcia lives even though the girl and her family insisted all along there had been a mistake 
The other girl had a scar but on the eyebrow and I have one on my nose Alondra Luna Nunez told the Associated Press 
I mean all this was stirred up over that 
The local judge in Mexico had refused to carry out a DNA test before sending her to the US saying that was not within the court s remit 
DNA tests carried out in Houston eventually revealed Alondra Luna Nunez was not Ms Garcia s daughter 
The girl was flown back to Mexico where she was re united with her parents 
Meanwhile Ms Garcia said she would not give up the search for her daughter of whom she had had no news since the girl was five 
On Monday a 13 year old girl appeared in a court in the western state of Michoacan along with her aunt and grandmother saying she was Alondra Diaz Garcia 
The girl told local media that she had been happy with my Dad but at the same time I felt there was something missing 
I have missed my mother s affection because I have not seen her for so long she said 
Her relatives said her father had decided to hand her over after he saw coverage of the confusion over Alondra Luna Nunez in the media 
Mexican officials are now expected to conduct DNA test to confirm whether the girl is indeed the daughter of Dorotea Garcia
