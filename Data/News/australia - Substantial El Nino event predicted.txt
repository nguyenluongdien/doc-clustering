The El Nino effect which can drive droughts and flooding is under way in the tropical Pacific say scientists 
Australia s Bureau of Meteorology predicted that it could become a substantial event later in the year 
The phenomenon arises from variations in ocean temperatures 
The El Nino is still in its early stages but has the potential to cause extreme weather around the world according to forecasters 
Australian scientists said models suggested it could strengthen from September onwards but it was too early to determine with confidence how strong it could be 
This is a proper El Nino effect it s not a weak one David Jones manager of climate monitoring and prediction at the Bureau of Meteorology told reporters 
You know there s always a little bit of doubt when it comes to intensity forecasts but across the models as a whole we d suggest that this will be quite a substantial El Nino event 
An El Nino comes along about every two to seven years as part of a natural cycle 
Every El Nino is different and once one has started models can predict how it might develop over the next six to nine months with a reasonable level of accuracy 
How can we predict El Nino 
In the tropical Pacific Ocean scientists operate a network of buoys that measure temperature currents and winds The data and other information from satellites and meteorological observations is fed into complex computer models designed to predict an El Nino However the models cannot predict the precise intensity or duration of an El Nino or the areas likely to be affected more than a few months ahead Researchers are trying to improve their models and observational work to give more advance notice 
A strong El Nino five years ago was linked with poor monsoons in Southeast Asia droughts in southern Australia the Philippines and Ecuador blizzards in the US heatwaves in Brazil and extreme flooding in Mexico 
Another strong El Nino event was expected during last year s record breaking temperatures but failed to materialise 
The likelihood of El Nino is high but its eventual strength in the winter when it has its major impacts worldwide is still unknown he said 
We will know in the summer how strong it is going to be 
The El Nino is a warming of the Pacific Ocean as part of a complex cycle linking atmosphere and ocean 
The phenomenon is known to disrupt weather patterns around the world and can bring wetter winters to the southwest US and droughts to northern Australia 
The consequences of El Nino are much less clear for Europe and the UK 
Research suggests that extreme El Nino events will become more likely as global temperatures rise
