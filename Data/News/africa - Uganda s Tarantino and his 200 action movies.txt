A Ugandan film company that makes low budget action movies in the slums has found a cult following online one US fan liked their films so much he abandoned New York to become an action movie star in Kampala 
It was December 2011 and things were not going well for Alan Hofmanis 
My girl dumped me the day I bought the wedding ring he says So a friend took him out to a Manhattan bar and to cheer him up showed him a video clip on his phone 
It was the trailer for Who Killed Captain Alex billed as Uganda s first action movie The minute long video showed bloody gun battles speeded up kung fu fights and computer generated helicopters bombing Kampala If you looked closely you could see that the machine guns replicas of Rambo s M60 had been welded from scrap metal and the bullets carved from wood Much of the action took place in mud A high pitched voiceover announced this was the work of Ramon Productions and gave a phone number 
The clip had an electrifying effect on Hofmanis Around 40 seconds into it I decided I m coming to Uganda he says I realised what I m looking at makes no sense but it s complete genius 
As programme director for the Lake Placid Film Festival Hofmanis was used to spotting emerging talent but he says what he saw here was off the charts in its ambition In the West when you have no money you shoot two people having a conversation You don t make a war film

Two weeks later he travelled to Uganda He didn t bother to call ahead his mind was made up 
On his first day in Kampala he was at a busy market when far in the distance he spotted a man wearing a T shirt that said Ramon Film Productions He immediately gave chase I just start running and I m chasing him so he starts running but we eventually catch up and we calm down and I say Look I m just a fan from New York City can you take me to the film maker 
The answer was Yes so Hofmanis jumped on the back of a motorcycle and 30 minutes later arrived in Wakaliga a slum on the outskirts of Kampala There are goats everywhere there are chickens everywhere That s raw sewage that s going right in front of the house and that actually plays a major role in the films because it s life here it s dust it s heat it s children it s animals and it s pure joy he says 
Isaac Nabwana the film director and brains behind Ramon Productions was not fazed by the unexpected arrival I asked him why didn t he call me He said I am a friend I had to reach you That s when I realised that he s a true friend he says Nabwana offered his visitor some tea and they spoke for five hours 
I thought I was going to meet someone like myself a little crazy with a camera and some friends and very quickly I realised this is the real deal says Hofmanis 
The volunteer cast and crew source props wherever they can The green screen is a piece of cloth bought at the market draped over a wall The camera crane is made from spare tractor parts Dauda Bissaso one of the regular actors is a mechanic and builds all the heavy gear and weapons He s just a genius with a blowtorch he makes everything says Hofmanis Another key member of the team is Bruce U a Bruce Lee fan who choreographs the fight scenes and runs a kung fu school for the children of Wakaliga 
To recreate gunshot injuries they use free condoms from the local health clinic filled with fake blood they burst quite realistically They used to be filled with real animal blood but when one of the actors got sick with brucellosis a disease passed on from cows they switched to food colouring 
Fake blood is needed in vast quantities because the films are violent but in a cartoonish way and quite unlike the real violence Nabwana witnessed growing up during Uganda s 1981 86 civil war I don t put that in my movies what I saw in the past he says I include comedy there was no comedy in the violence which I witnessed 
His cinematic hero is Chuck Norris although he also likes Rambo and The Expendables Hofmanis on the other hand compares him to directors like Guillermo del Toro Robert Rodriguez and Martin Scorsese in terms of creativity and what they re contributing to cinema 
Nabwana s love for films began long before he was allowed to watch any his older brother Kizito would return from the local cinema hall and describe what he d seen in vivid detail I remember the gestures he used there was a guy who used to crush people so I liked that says Nabwana Even now I see them in my head 
At senior school Nabwana decided he would make his own action movies one day I had that art in me I wanted to make a movie I had to fulfil that dream he says 
But there was not enough money for him to even finish school So I started making bricks and digging sand to sell to people around here he says 
Finally in 2006 at the age of 32 Nabwana had saved up enough to pay for the first month of a six month course in computer maintenance That was enough to know how to assemble a computer he says He then taught himself how to use editing packages such as Premiere Pro and After Effects and borrowed a camera from a neighbour And with that I started I did not know how to write a script But then I thought of these drama actors how do they do it And I started figuring it out 
Tebaatusasula was one of his earliest successes the name translates loosely as They never paid us 
It mixes comedy action and witchcraft one character bewitches a man who has stolen his wife In Tebaatusasula things jumped out of the house chairs the TVs and everything and people loved that very much says Nabwana 
But his biggest challenge was yet to come 
Unable to find a distributor Nabwana came up with an ingenious solution the actors and crew work for nothing but get to keep half the profits from any DVDs they sell We do man to man door to door all over the country to sell them he says The films can sell for up to 3 000 shillings about 1 but the team only has a window of about a week before they are pirated They sometimes wear full costume to maximise sales 
It was on such a sales trip that they had bumped into Hofmanis 
As soon as they met Nabwana agreed to write a role for Hofmanis who felt like he was 10 years old again When I was a child I would go through my father s closet find two belts of his tie them together and now I m Indiana Jones And the trees are Nazis That s what this is he says 
So two days after arriving in Uganda he found himself filming a fight scene It didn t quite go to plan I grab someone in the scene and we fall into the raw sewage and we start fighting there He says everyone was amazed to see an American rolling around in sewage That in some ways was my baptism here Only people who are from the slums behave this way because they grow up with sewage it doesn t mean much to them They honoured him with a Ugandan name Ssali 
Sewage plays a part in all of Nabwana s movies He purposely includes such details because he wants to reflect his surroundings his films are from the slums by the slum It s part of their appeal What I ve found out is that people want to see what they live in They want their life to be put on DVD They like it very much he says 
But he admits that this puts off distributors whom he has accused of trying to copy exactly what is done in the West and exactly what is done in Bollywood and Hollywood 
After that first trip in December 2011 Hofmanis visited six more times Then in March 2014 the 45 year old sold his possessions and moved to Wakaliga Back in New York I got rid of everything I had put my stuff in storage but I couldn t even afford the 22 14 per month it cost he says I m all in 
He s now part of my family says Nabwana 42 who lives with his wife Harriet and three children Hofmanis moved in next door 
They have big plans for the studio A Kickstarter fundraising project launched in March exceeded all expectations All we asked for was 160 105 to make a movie but we got 13 000 8 500 says Hofmanis 
They immediately went on a shopping spree buying toy cars and trucks to blow up the trick is to match them to what Bissaso can find in the local scrap yards so they can be used for stunts 
The team spend a lot of time discussing weapons Nabwana now plans to build a full scale helicopter from scrap He has a fondness for choppers and remembers being chased by one during the civil war when he was about 12 years old His brother s cinematic knowledge kicked in and they tried to outrun it the helicopter followed He chuckles at the memory 
Wakaliwood currently has six films in production including Bad Black a kind of reverse Karate Kid starring the children of Wakaliga And they are inviting fans from around the world to submit scenes for the world s first crowd sourced action film called Tebaatusasula EBOLA 
Hofmanis describes life in Wakaliwood as a lazy country afternoon punctuated by the unpredictable As one of the few white men around he s in demand as an actor He has played Jesus in a chart topping music video For another role he had to crawl into a fresh goat s carcass so when the cannibals plunge a knife into my chest they re pulling out the goat s intestines and not my own 
But on his personal blog Mud Blood Wooden Guns he hints at darker moments He has lost 55 lbs 25kg in weight since he arrived 15 months ago In October last year he compared his situation to the 70s cult thriller Sorcerer I wound up in a third world country with no way to get home It does not end well 
He has swapped a comfortable Western existence for life in a slum without running water or plumbing no sewage system and with barely any electricity People can be confused that they see us with internet a 3G modem that I brought here and making movies so the default is it cannot be a slum says Hofmanis 
But that s the whole point Wakaliwood should not be able to do what it does But it s happening 
The story is still being written This is just the beginning or the Beginning of the Beginning as Isaac says 
But in the end it may be Hofmanis story that attracts Hollywood s attention 
Going to the movies in Uganda 
Watching a movie can be a raucous affair films are translated into local languages such as Luganda by VJs or video jokers who add their own jokes and improvised commentary live When you are translating the movie you have to feel like you are in the movie says VJ Emmie whose video hall can attract an audience of up to 200 for a live show We normally do not change the meaning of the film but we spice it up 
Emmie wanted to be a VJ from the age of six because he realised it would make him popular I went to the cinema hall and watched this guy translating a movie and the first benches around him it was women When I went back home I told my mother I want to be a VJ mother wanted me to be a tailor
