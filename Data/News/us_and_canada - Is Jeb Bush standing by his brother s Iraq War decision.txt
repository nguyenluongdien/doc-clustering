Being the brother of a former president with a controversial war on his record is proving to be a tricky position for former Florida Governor Jeb Bush 
It took less than 24 hours for his political supporters to begin walking back that statement however after he was subjected to withering criticism from the left and the right 
Ana Navarro an adviser to Mr Bush who served on his staff when he was governor said she emailed Mr Bush on Tuesday about the remark and he told her that he didn t hear Fox host Megyn Kelly correctly 
The latter version of the question is a fairly common one for candidates of all political stripes and for the most part it results in a dispassionate discussion of faulty intelligence missed opportunities and unintended consequences not too different from the way Mr Bush answered

She added that comments like that show that Mr Bush is ill qualified to be the Republican nominee 
You have to have someone who says look I m a Republican but I m not an idiot I m not stupid she said I learn from the past and I improve myself 
Another conservative commentator the Washington Examiner s Byron York writes that the Iraq issue isn t going to go away for Jeb Bush especially if he continues mishandling what should be easy questions 
Mr Bush s staff have said since that his comments were about Israel policy specifically not the Middle East in general Some members of the audience at the event disagree however

This week s events highlight that the pedigreed surname has some very particular challenges as well
