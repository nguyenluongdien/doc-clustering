Where would you business be without your customers Likely out of business right Managing your clients and finding and engaging potential new clients is vital to keeping a business running That s why a proper CRM solution is a must Here are three CRM apps that take different paths to managing customer relations 
Zoho CRM lets you see where your contacts are 
CRM is just one of the apps available from Zoho a company that was an early entrant in the market for Web based office suites What s especially nice about Zoho is that the company has continued to offer free versions of its app that are full featured something that many of its competitors has abandoned as the popularity of Web based apps has surged in recent years 
The mobile interface is basic but easy enough to use once you ve figured your way around Zoho CRM The company would do well to add a few introductory videos or tutorials that would make it easier for users to get up to speed quickly after all as a free and low cost app Zoho CRM is likely to attract novices I also wish it were easier to create tasks directly from emails and that the app offered the ability to create more robust reports Still Zoho CRM offers a great value for small businesses who need to watch their budget 
Insightly s mobile app is neatly designed and easy to use 
There s a lot to like about Insightly including its mobile version which runs on Android and iOS Included with the free version Insightly s mobile app offers many of the features you ll find in its desktop version including its Project Management features I like how Insightly ties Project Management in with CRM allowing you to create and assign projects from within the app Zoho which offers its own Project Management tool would benefit from a similar feature 
Insightly s mobile app looks a whole lot like Zoho s though its graphics and overall design are a bit more defined Its main screen from which you can choose to manage and create Tasks Contacts Organizations Opportunities Projects and Emails appears from the right side of your device Selecting any of the available options lets you drill down deeper into that topic Like Zoho CRM Insightly could be a bit overwhelming at first though the company s Web site does offer videos to help you get started 
If you re a very small business looking to get started with CRM especially if you need integrated Project Management Insightly is a good choice 
Nimble keeps the focus squarely on your contacts 
Nimble does not offer a free version past its 14 day trial period after that you pay 15 per user per month That s slightly more expensive than Insightly s and Zoho s entry level paid versions But anyone who uses social media to conduct business will appreciate Nimble s bent It brings in all of the different communications from your contacts including status updates tweets emails and more and allows you to see them through the lens of a CRM tool with features like deals and activities 
The mobile app available for Android and iOS is well designed and easy to use allowing you to see Nimble s Contact Cards for all of your contacts What it doesn t offer is the overview that the Web based app has where you see a list of engagement opportunities from important contacts birthdays and job changes and more The Web version also shows more useful details about your contacts shared contacts for example that the mobile app lacks 
Overall Nimble is a great tool for managing and engaging with your contacts especially if you rely on social media for your business But its mobile app is missing some key features found in its Web based version
