If the waiter was rude your hotel room dirty or the plumber sloppy you should be able to say so online without fear of getting slapped with a lawsuit 
So said a group of lawmakers who want to make it illegal for U S businesses to use contracts to preemptively muzzle customers so they can t post negative reviews 
The company demanded the couple take down a negative review they wrote on Ripoffreport com saying they violated its terms of service specifically a part that reads Your acceptance of this sales contract prohibits you from taking any action that negatively impacts KlearGear com After the couple refused to pay the fee KlearGear reported them to credit agencies 
The new legislation is similar to a bill introduced by two of its sponsors in 2014 that failed to pass in Congress 
Internet users should be free to engage in all types of commerce and communication including product and business reviews said Representative Darrell Issa a California Republican and a sponsor of the new legislation

Customers shouldn t be punished for an honest review Representative Eric Swallwell a California Democrat added in a statement This is commonsense legislation to ensure the rights of consumers are protected and to penalize businesses attempting to silence fair criticism 
The issue may be bigger than non disparagement clauses in consumer contracts however Congress should look for additional ways to discourage lawsuits filed against customers who post negative online reviews the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation a tech focused think tank said this week 
Good anti SLAPP legislation would require plaintiffs in such lawsuits to prove actual malice by reviewers and would allow courts to award costs and attorneys fees to defendants ITIF said 
It s unclear how big of a problem SLAPPs are said Daniel Castro vice president at ITIF and co author of the report 
Exact numbers are hard to track because nobody says I m filing a SLAPP Castro said by email Similarly if someone threatens a SLAPP there may not even be a public record 
However there have been reports of numerous cases where companies filed lawsuits or threatened to take action against reviewers he added It s important to address this before the problem escalates because we do not want people to believe falsely that posting truthful information can get them in trouble he wrote 
While 28 states have anti SLAPP laws a federal law is needed because those laws are not uniform and other states do not have them Castro said We don t want consumers on vacation to have to consult a lawyer before posting a review about the hotel or restaurant they visit he said Federal legislation would create a national baseline so any consumer no matter where they live or travel in the United States could respond to a SLAPP
