Past political trouble in the U S isn t stopping Huawei Technologies from selling its enterprise services in the country 
Huawei however hopes it can still attract U S customers to its enterprise products which include servers storage and IT services 
We hope that in every market vendors will be treated fairly said David He the company s president of marketing for its enterprise group Huawei executives have also talked with U S customers and partners and they all welcome a new player to enter the market he added 
The U S represents a large market We are continually working to expand in this market He said at a press conference on Wednesday 
The optimism comes as Huawei is betting it can steadily build its presence in the enterprise IT space The Chinese company makes nearly all its revenue from selling networking gear and consumer products such as smartphones But in the future Huawei wants its enterprise business to drive much of its growth 
Last year it made about US 3 2 billion in revenue from enterprise products but by 2019 Huawei wants that figure to reach 10 billion 
Originally Huawei hoped to reach the 10 billion number in 2018 but pushed the target date back a year 
On Wednesday Huawei played down the change and said it would take time for customers to recognize its products Now we think we have a better understanding of the different markets He said 
I think in every region our market share is very very low he later added We hope that in every country we can maintain a fast growth 
China has been a key driver for its existing sales according to analysts Huawei has been selling over half of its storage products in its home market said Jimmie Chang an analyst with research firm Gartner 
Huawei established its enterprise business group in 2011 and has since introduced in the market technologies that can rival those of its competitors according to Chang 
But if they want to reach the 10 billion figure the Chinese market won t be enough he added In addition global demand for certain enterprise IT products isn t exactly growing Last year for instance the storage market only grew by 1 percent year over year Chang said 
IDC analyst Matt Eastwood said Huawei s best chance to expand is to target emerging markets In many of these countries the company already has strong relationships with local mobile carriers through its networking business 
As for the U S Huawei probably won t have an easy time finding customers 
Certain sensitive U S industries such as government aerospace and defense will prefer to buy from U S companies Eastwood said However there are plenty of other industries such as retail hospitality and wholesale services that are focused on buying IT products with the best value 
The greater challenge for Huawei is trying to surmount existing competition from the likes of Cisco and EMC Enterprise IT users are slow to change brands he added 
If anything the situation is worsening not improving Chang said The U S political climate could change but right now it s still hard for Chinese companies
