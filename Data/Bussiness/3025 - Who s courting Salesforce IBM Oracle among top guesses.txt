A report that Salesforce com is entertaining takeover offers whipped up a storm of speculation Wednesday as analysts and other observers mulled the possibility and what it could mean for the enterprise software market 
It would require a massive deal for that to happen noted Ray Wang founder and principal analyst with Constellation Research Salesforce still has a lot of growth ahead 
Salesforce did not respond to a request for comment 
Rumors have swirled for some time that Salesforce is for sale Wang noted and clearly suitors would have to be very large companies 
You d have to ask who could afford it and who could get it done said Michael Fauscette a group vice president with IDC The afford list is maybe IBM Oracle SAP Apple Microsoft 
In the who could get it done category however the list is much shorter Fauscette added IBM might seem like a logical choice but I wonder if the fairly new CEO could pull it off and whether Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff would let that happen 
Oracle is a more likely candidate and don t rule out SAP he added 
Also worth remembering is Oracle s acquisition of Sun when then Oracle CEO Larry Ellison let someone else set the price but wasn t willing to lose the deal according to Fauscette 
Oracle also got the vote of Frank Scavo president of Computer Economics 
Microsoft SAP HP and IBM were all on Scavo s list of possibilities but both Microsoft and SAP would have to integrate Salesforce s software with their respective Azure and Hana platforms I dont think either Microsoft or SAP would want to plop down 50 billion just to have the opportunity to start work on a big infrastructure project Scavo said 
HP meanwhile couldnt make the Autonomy acquisition fly for 10 billion so Im not sure theyd want to try Salesforce for five times that amount he added 
The logical buyer is IBM said Denis Pombriant managing principal at Beagle Research Group The company could afford it and they have cash that they don t know what to do with they are buying back shares to increase shareholder value Pombriant noted 
In addition aside from its consulting business IBM doesn t have a big portfolio of future invention that will carry it forward so an acquisition is logical he added If it does turn out to be IBM Oracle will make a play in its own defense and while we re at it HP will join the fray for similar reasons Pombriant predicted 
Of course the cultural differences are stark between Salesforce and IBM he noted 
Salesforce is California laid back IBM is New York pinstripes Salesforce is a risk taker and IBM is risk averse he said I don t think Benioff or his company would survive in IBM IBM is where software companies go to die 
Regardless of the identity of any potential buyers there could be several factors motivating Salesforce to consider putting the company up for sale 
The best time to sell of course is when the share price is at or near its top Scavo pointed out So its possible that Salesforce sees selling out as a better opportunity right now than to continue to invest for growth 
The company may feel the need of a larger organization to help it perhaps to fill in the lack of their own infrastructure portfolio suggested IDC research manager Larry Carvalho 
In the end the company is obligated to shareholders to entertain all offers Wang pointed out What they really want to do is get ahead of that and put in a mechanism to ensure a fair and objective process
