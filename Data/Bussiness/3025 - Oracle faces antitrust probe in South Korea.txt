The investigation which apparently has been under way for some time reportedly focuses on Oracle s insistence that customers pay for maintenance services for all the Oracle software they use rather than choose different maintenance vendors 
Oracle declined to comment and the FTC did not respond to a request to comment for this story 
Results of the probe are expected to be released in June or July A fine could amount to as much as three percent of sales Shin said according to the Korea Herald 
Maintenance contracts have always been a significant and significantly profitable part of Oracle s business said Charles King principal analyst with Pund IT in an email interview 
The company also has a history of acting aggressively toward organizations it believes are infringing on its turf as evidenced by lawsuits it has pursued against third party maintenance players he said 
These points might be factors in the Korea investigation but the larger issue is likely one faced by every global vendor Practices considered a common part of business in one country or locale might be considered uncommonly onerous in another King said In order not to run afoul in such situations a wise vendor will correct its course to avoid potential dangers 
Oracle may have failed to pursue that strategy in Korea he added so it s worth considering whether the company faces similarly rough waters in other markets
