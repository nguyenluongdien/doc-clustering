Chinese authorities visited an Uber office in the country on Wednesday just a week after another company office faced a local police raid over its ride hailing service 
Local authorities came to Uber s office in the Chinese city of Chengdu Uber confirmed in en email But the visit was routine it added 
There are no disruptions to the Uber platform and it s business as usual the company said 
Chengdu authorities have opened an investigation against Uber but its office has not been closed according to local media Uber did not elaborate and Chengdu s Transportation Committee could not be immediately reached for comment 
Uber recently entered the Chinese market But its practice of helping private car owners connect with customers in need of ride was banned in the country earlier this year 
However Uber is still operating in the country and has managed to sidestep the ban by employing licensed car rental firms to offer its ride hailing service although the prices can be high 
In addition the company also offers a People s Uber service that still attempts to help private car owners find customers wanting transportation The customer fees for this service tend to be lower than local taxi fares and Uber claims to make no profit from it 
People s Uber is available in Chengdu and Guangzhou besides several other Chinese cities 
As of Thursday the Uber service in Chengdu was still online Uber has said it s cooperating with the authorities
