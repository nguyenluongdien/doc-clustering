Google could face increased scrutiny from Wednesday when the European Commission outlines its strategy to make European companies more competitive online and to simplify online shopping and movie streaming across borders 
A major concern for the Commission is the growing power of the U S tech companies providing the search app store e commerce and social media platforms on which many online businesses rely 
While the draft did not name companies the probe s focus on transparency in search results including paid links and advertising will concern Google It will be separate from ongoing EU antitrust investigations into the company the FT reported 
Other tech companies could also expect some scrutiny The Commission said it will review telecommunications and media regulations to adapt them to IP based services such as Skype WhatsApp and Netflix which are increasingly being used by consumers instead of traditional forms of communication or entertainment 
The Commission also wants online platforms to facilitate the swift removal of illegal content While no final plans have been presented yet the Computer Communications Industry Association CCIA representing platform companies Amazon com Facebook Google and Microsoft among others reacted to the leaks on Monday saying that it would be a bad idea to regulate platforms as regulation would hit European companies hardest 
The CCIA also strongly opposed what it called a duty of care for Internet companies to monitor judge and remove user or third party content on networks and hosting platforms This it said would undermine existing measures in place to respond to problems online that strike a balance between freedom of speech commercial freedom and controlling infringing material 
Digital purchases can simply be downloaded but anything else has to be delivered often at high cost so the Commission wants to bring down cross border parcel delivery prices Early next year it plans to improve transparency and enhance regulatory oversight of parcel delivery according to the leaked draft 
By the end of 2015 it also aims to propose changes to copyright rules so people can access legally acquired content including music and movies from anywhere in the EU not just their home country 
The Commission is also seeking swift adoption of the Data Protection Regulation which should address concerns of Europeans who worry that they have to reveal too much personal data online The new rules should be ready by the end of the year 
Further details of the proposals will be published Wednesday The Commission declined to comment on them ahead of publication
