Lionel Messi: Barcelona forward 'from another dimension' - Enrique

Barcelona forward Lionel Messi is "a player from another dimension", according to the club's manager Luis Enrique.
The Argentina international, 27, scored twice in his side's 3-0 Champions League semi-final first-leg victory over Bayern Munich at the Nou Camp.
"We created many more chances than our rival and in a thrilling final 15 minutes he put them in," said Enrique.
"Beyond what Leo did in attack, look at what how much he ran in defence."
After Barcelona missed several opportunities in the first half, German champions Bayern were slowly starting to impress themselves on the game until Messi struck on 77 minutes, rifling the ball past Manuel Neuer from the edge of the area.
Just three minutes later he skipped past Jerome Boateng before lifting the ball over Neuer. He also provided the assist for Barca's third goal, scored by Neymar in injury time.
