A secret Google Maps feature has peeked its head from behind the curtain giving you an even faster way to find your upcoming trip details 
For this to work you ll need to have your reservation confirmation emails inside of your Gmail account so Google can mine them for the right information 
You can now ask for a listing of your flights reservations and other details with voice commands inside Google Maps 
Unfortunately these commands don t work from the homepage or Google Search app you ll need to be inside of the Maps application
