Cars and light vans in the European Union will be fitted with an automatic emergency call device as of March 2018 now that the European Parliament approved rules that make such a system mandatory 
Called eCall the system will automatically alert emergency services in case of a car crash Its aim is to reduce the death toll caused by road accidents in the EU by 10 percent potentially saving 2 500 lives per year while also reducing the severity of injuries and cut the cost of traffic jams eCall will enable an audio channel between vehicles and emergency services via a public mobile wireless communications network 
The system was approved despite some privacy concerns over a government mandated in vehicle system 
The rules also prohibit emergency centers or their service partners to transfer data to third parties without explicit consent while manufacturers also have to ensure that the eCall technology design permits full and permanent deletion of data gathered it added 
Despite these changes some Members of the European Parliament have warned that even though the system is dormant most of the time it still has to be active in some way to send a signal with location data based on GPS and that such a system could also be vulnerable to hackers Nonetheless the majority of the Parliament apparently thought these risks acceptable 
As of March 31 2018 all new models of passenger cars and light vans will have to be equipped with eCall Three years after this period the European Commission the EU s executive body will assess if eCall should be installed in other vehicles such as buses coaches or trucks the Parliament said 
As the Parliament s vote ends the EU legislative procedure the regulation will enter into force 20 days after its publication in the Official Journal of the European Union
