Susie Wolff admits she feels very far away from becoming the first woman to race in Formula 1 for 40 years 
I have shown I am capable I m in a very competitive team I drive a car which is capable of podium positions Wolff said 
That was a sign that Yes you re close but you are still very far away she said 
Williams went into the season without an official reserve driver with Wolff designated as test driver and British GP2 driver Alex Lynn their development driver 
Wolff now 32 has not raced at all since 2012 when she completed the last of seven years in the DTM German touring car championship 
And a new point based qualifying system for super licences to be introduced next year will make it all the harder for those who have not won junior or qualifying championships 
To find the budget to go through all those formulas to get into the right team so that you actually win the championship in those formulas that is a huge task for any driver regardless of gender Wolff added 
I hope it will get tweaked and adjusted 
Love it or hate it motorsport is not purely talent It never has been and never will be 
Wolff will test again in Austria in June ahead of another practice appearance at the British GP on 3 July
