Oracle will probably come out ahead if one of its rivals buys Salesforce com because it would turn Oracle s superior focus into an even greater advantage Co CEO Safra Catz said Thursday 
If it s acquired by somebody else it s probably good for us to be honest Catz told reporters at a media event at Oracle Because everybody brings their own stuff to these things 
Catz declined to comment on whether Oracle made the overture to Salesforce that was reported on Wednesday by Bloomberg citing unnamed sources But the company spent much of the day driving home the point that it has everything it needs to win in the cloud market 
Disruption is always opportunity for the guy who s on mission Catz said It would probably help Oracle in the short to medium term at least though ultimately it would depend on who made the acquisition she said 
Oracle has spent 10 years building its cloud portfolio which includes three major products delivered as services software SaaS platform PaaS and infrastructure IaaS Oracle executives said It lets customers choose which elements to buy as cloud services and which to run on premises which sets Oracle apart from rivals they said 
It s the only company with a complete suite of cloud based applications co CEO Mark Hurd said Enterprises won t want to buy separate cloud applications from specialists such as Salesforce and Workday because it s too expensive and time consuming to integrate those products into a company s overall operations he said 
The only other enterprise software vendor with a complete suite is SAP and it s missed the boat on cloud computing Catz and Hurd said SAP is still a bigger application vendor but Oracle expects to pass its rival soon 
We re not about winning by a nose We re going to pass those guys by a mile Catz said
