Spain s footballers will find out on Thursday if their planned strike to halt the final part of the La Liga season can legally go ahead 
The Spanish Football Federation RFEF has suspended the end of the season with the players union AFE agreeing to strike in a row over TV rights 
The final two rounds of Liga games and the Copa del Rey final are in doubt 
Barcelona who play Athletic Bilbao in the cup final are only one game away from regaining the league title 
The Catalan club would become champions by beating current holders Atletico Madrid on Sunday if the game is played 
Barcelona players Andres Iniesta and Xavi plus Real Madrid rivals Iker Casillas and Sergio Ramos are among the top flight players backing the planned strike 
The RFEF and AFE are not satisfied with a new law passed by the Spanish government and supported by the league LFP introducing collective bargaining for domestic television rights Currently Real Madrid and Barcelona receive most of the TV money 
Legal representatives for the AFE and LFP appeared at a court hearing on Wednesday putting forward their arguments over the legality of the players s strike 
The league s lawyer Javier Suarez asked the court to revoke the planned action because the economic damage would be impossible to repair He claimed the strike could cost the league about 36m 50 million euros per matchday in lost revenues 
However the union disputed the claim and insisted it was groundless because potential losses were not irreversible
