Warwickshire 21 pts Worcestershire 3 pts 
Match scorecard 
Jeetan Patel took 4 69 and reached 500 first class wickets as Warwickshire beat Worcestershire by 181 runs 
The New Zealand born spinner 35 trapped Alex Gidman lbw for 12 to reach his personal milestone at Edgbaston 
Resuming on 88 2 and chasing 437 for victory Worcestershire captain Daryl Mitchell 38 and Tom Fell 33 offered resistance until just before lunch 
Both were dismissed in the space of three balls starting Worcestershire s demise as they were bowled out for 255 
It was Warwickshire s first Championship win of the season following draws with Hampshire and Yorkshire while Worcestershire have lost three of their four matches since returning to Division One 
Nightwatchman Charlie Morris hung around for more than six overs early on with Mitchell whose obdurate innings of 38 from 172 balls was ended when Rankin forced him to edge to Rikki Clarke at second slip 
Fell was out lbw in the next over to Patel who also accounted for Gidman shortly after lunch to leave the visitors 160 6 and staring at defeat 
Wicketkeeper Ben Cox top scored with 44 but was caught behind to become Patel s fourth victim and Keith Barker 3 42 had Sri Lanka international Sachithra Senanayake caught at slip to complete victory 
In this game again we still did not quite hit our straps but we showed more prolonged glimpses of the way we like to play cricket and we got the result we wanted 
I was pleased to get to 500 wickets Before I came to England this year I knew I was pretty close and the main thing was to do the job for Warwickshire and then the wickets would come with that 
It is nice to tick the 500 off and now I can get on with the rest of the season 
We were put under pressure by the way we batted in the first innings when we were bowled out in 42 overs That puts you in a very delicate position and it s the real reason why we ended up losing 
You can t afford to have a bad session in four day cricket as we have had in the three games we have lost 
The nature of the game is to wait for the opportunity to get in front and ram it home and that s what Warwickshire did ever so well
