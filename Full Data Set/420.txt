James Anderson surpassed Sir Ian Botham as England s highest Test wicket taker with his 384th dismissal in his 100th match 
Anderson 32 had West Indies Denesh Ramdin caught at first slip on the final day of the first Test in Antigua 
The seamer who began the Test on 380 wickets was mobbed by his team mates as his family celebrated in the crowd 
Lancashire s Anderson who made his Test debut in 2003 has helped England win three Ashes series and rise to the top of the Test rankings in 2011 
All rounder Botham took 383 wickets in 102 Tests between 1977 and 1992 as well as scoring 5 200 runs at an average of 33 54 
Anderson bettered Botham s tally in two matches fewer as England pressed for victory at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in the first Test of the three match series 
Having taken two wickets in the first innings he had Marlon Samuels taken at gully midway through the morning session to move level with Botham 
But he had to wait until an hour of play remained before he located Ramdin s edge removing the West Indies captain for 57 courtesy of a smart catch by Alastair Cook and ending a seventh wicket stand of 105
