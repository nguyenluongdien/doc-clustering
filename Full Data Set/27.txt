The European Commission plans sweeping rule changes to better combat online terrorism and cybercrime 
Old laws and rules that aren t stringent enough such as those regulating the sale of firearms online need to be revised Timmermans said It is unacceptable that a Kalashnikov can be bought easily on the Internet he said New rules are also needed to battle financial fraud because the current framework is outdated in areas like virtual currency and online payment he said 
The Commission proposed such a forum last year and in October brought together EU national Interior ministers and senior representatives from Google Facebook Twitter and Microsoft However the Commission seeks a dialogue with a wider range of companies said a Commission official adding that participants will determine the topics and measures to be discussed 
More cooperation between EU law enforcement agencies is also needed said Timmermans who called for more data sharing among these agencies The priority is to identify and overcome obstacles to criminal investigations such as access to Internet based evidence and information 
Europol will also be reformed and given responsibility for creating a European counterterrorist center to support national authorities efforts against terrorists terrorist financing extremist online content and illicit trafficking of firearms the Commission said 
At the same time already proposed reforms including new data protection rules should be dealt with quickly Timmermans said He also called for a swift introduction of a controversial plan to retain and share passenger flight data across the EU The Passenger Name Record PNR system would help prevent detect probe and prosecute terrorist offenses and serious transnational crime according to the Commission 
However the plan for such a database could face resistance from several members of the European Parliament Jan Philipp Albrecht vice chairman of the Parliament s Committee on Civil Liberties said in a statement that the mass surveillance of airline passengers will not make people safer 
The Commission asked the EU s other two law making bodies the European Parliament and the Council of the EU to endorse the plans in order to renew the EU s Internal Security Strategy which sets out the challenges principles and guidelines for dealing with security threats The strategy should be the basis for cooperation and joint action on security for the next five years it said
