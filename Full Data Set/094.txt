Ola India s largest ride hailing service is being probed by the Competition Commission of India for predatory pricing including for allegedly spending more than its revenue per trip by offering incentives to customers and drivers 
The probe reflects the fierce competition in the Indian ride hailing market with a number of well funded companies investing large sums to get a quick lead in the market 
The CCI has initiated the investigation following a complaint by rival Fast Track Call Cab that ANI Technologies which runs Ola is using funds raised including from Japan s SoftBank to wipe out equally efficient competitors who cannot indulge in such predatory pricing in the radio taxi services market Fast Track has also charged Ola with creating barriers for new entrants 
The CCI has clubbed together taxi services that offer booking by phone or computer or through an app as radio taxi services which it considers different from traditional yellow black colored taxis that have been in operation in the country for years It has also arrived at the preliminary conclusion that Ola holds a dominant position in the radio taxi services market of Bangalore which was the city named in the complaint 
Fast Track has also alleged that Ola restricts its driver fleet operators from using any other competing platform for providing their services Ola is also said to have incentivized its drivers unrealistically by using the money raised from foreign investors which cannot be matched by existing radio cab operators or local enterprises planning to start similar operations in the country 
Based on the material placed on record the CCI observed that Ola spends per trip around 574 rupees US 9 while earning an average revenue of 344 rupees leading to a direct loss of 230 rupees per trip 
While the propriety of these figures is a subject matter of investigation prima facie the Commission is of the view that they indicate predatory pricing aimed to oust other players from the relevant market the agency said 
ANI acquired in March a smaller rival TaxiForSure run by Serendipity Infolabs for 200 million 
The potential of the Indian market has become evident with Uber Technologies making a pitch for it But the U S company ran into a controversy in December with local authorities after its driver in Delhi allegedly raped a woman passenger Uber was banned in the city after the incident Other app based taxi companies have also come under scrutiny following the rape Delhi s transport department framed new rules called the Radio Taxi Scheme which puts tighter controls on taxi operators 
ANI did not immediately comment on the CCI probe
