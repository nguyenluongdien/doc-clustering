A developer edition of Box will allow enterprises to build applications on top of the company s content collaboration and sharing capabilities without using the Box user interface or requiring users to have a Box account 
The announcement of the Developer Edition at the Box Dev conference is the company s latest step beyond its legacy as a storage sync and sharing service and toward its higher calling as a platform company Box aims to provide cloud resources like big names such as Amazon Web Services do but with additional features that take more work off developer s plate when creating an enterprise application 
Since it went public in January Box has been under scrutiny for signs of a path to profit Box s traditional service is up against competing products such as Google Drive and Microsoft OneDrive from bigger companies with other ways to make money That makes cloud storage by itself a commodity business with brutal price competition so the company is reaching higher with more differentiated features said Chris Yeh senior vice president of product and platform in an interview at Box Dev 
The tool can help companies quickly develop collaborative applications that let users share content said Heidi Williams senior director of platform engineering She gave the example of Exitround an anonymous online marketplace for technology mergers and acquisitions Exitround was able to set up file sharing among would be buyers and sellers with access controls for different roles she said Box Developer Edition is in closed beta 
Box already provides APIs application programming interfaces that let third party tools such as Microsoft Office 365 tap into Box for certain capabilities The Developer Edition would bring Box into the foundation of the app itself 
Also at Box Dev the company announced more mobile SDKs software development kits for adding Box features into applications The new Browse Share and Preview SDKs add capabilities from Box for each of those actions They can be added one by one to keep apps as small as possible when other features aren t needed The Browse and Share SDKs are available now and the Preview SDK is coming soon Box said
