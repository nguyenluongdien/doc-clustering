The unrest began on 26 April after the 51 year old president said he would run for re election in June

The constitution states a president can only be elected to two terms in office but earlier this month the country s constitutional court upheld Mr Nkurunziza s interpretation 
More than 20 people have died and tens of thousands of Burundians have fled to neighbouring states since the unrest began
