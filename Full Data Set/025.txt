Europe s e commerce market will be subject to a full fledged antitrust probe as part of the European Commission s push to tear down walls between the European Union s 28 national digital markets 
The Commission suspects contractual restrictions in distribution agreements prevent retailers from selling goods or services purchased online to customers in other EU countries The investigation will examine how widespread these barriers are and what effects they have on competition and consumers If they are anti competitive we will not hesitate to take enforcement action under EU antitrust rules Vestager said in an emailed statement 
Companies including manufacturers wholesalers and e commerce retailers can expect to receive a request for information from the Commission in the coming weeks It expects to publish preliminary findings of the inquiry in mid 2016 
Making cross border e commerce easier for consumers and companies is high on the Commission s agenda It plans to harmonize rules on contracts and consumer protection for online purchases to boost confidence to shop and sell across borders 
It will also propose measures to make parcel delivery more affordable 62 percent of companies that try to sell online find excessive parcel delivery costs are a barrier it said 
Unjustified geo blocking must also end the Commission said Some online sellers deny consumers access to a website based on their location or re route them to a local store with different prices Legislative proposals to tackle unjustified geo blocking should be ready before the end of the year it said 
At the same time it will also reform Value Added Tax VAT rules to relieve the administrative burden especially on small and medium size enterprises so that sellers of physical goods to other countries also benefit from single electronic registration and payment 
The e commerce probe is not the only scrutiny tech companies can expect As part of its Digital Single Market strategy the Commission will also comprehensively analyze the role of online platforms including search engines social media and app stores 
The probe to be conducted before the end of the year will likely target U S tech giants such as Google Apple and Amazon com It will consider pricing policies the transparency of search results and companies use the personal information It ill also examine how platforms promote their own services to the disadvantage of competitors to the extent these are not already covered by competition law the Commission said 
The Commission s digital strategy is meant to lay the groundwork for the future of Europe s digital economy and as such also includes plans for giving European startups a better chance to grow and developing pan continental telecommunications networks 
It also includes a push to reform copyright rules Before the end of 2015 the Commission will propose ways to reduce the differences between national copyright regimes and allow for wider online access to works across the EU As part of the reform people who buy films music or articles online at home should be able to access to them from other countries At the same time enforcement against commercial scale infringements of intellectual property rights will be stepped up 
Plans should be more concrete by the end of 2016 and will need backing from the European Parliament and the Council of the EU to become reality
