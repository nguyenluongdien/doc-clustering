Besides connecting with friends Facebook is fast becoming the place to watch videos Billions of videos 
Facebook is now serving up more than 4 billion videos to its users daily CEO Mark Zuckerberg said Wednesday The figure is striking in part because it s increasing so fast In January Facebook was showing 3 billion videos a day 
Video is a big opportunity for us COO Sheryl Sandberg said during Facebook s quarterly earnings call Besides being a way for users to share content it s a way for marketers to advertise on the site 
One reason Facebook s viewing count is so high is that videos uploaded to Facebook now play automatically Facebook defines a view as three seconds or more so people are likely to rack up views just scrolling through their news feed Still it s an indication of how much video is on the site 
The 4 billion figure includes both user content and advertisements Facebook started letting marketers publish video ads that play automatically in late 2013 
Facebook didn t say on Wednesday how much of the video increase comes from ads versus user uploaded content But it does see video as a critical medium for advertising as it looks to siphon ad spending dollars away from YouTube and traditional TV 
Facebook s total revenue for the quarter ended March 31 was US 3 54 billion up more than 40 percent from last year Nearly three quarters of its sales were derived from ads placed on mobile devices The company says it has more than 2 million active advertisers 
More than 75 percent of Facebook s video views occur on mobile devices the company said Wednesday Facebook now has 1 44 billion users who log in every month up 13 percent from last year it said
