Facing little work in his regular construction job Li Gengming has become a big supporter of Uber Technologies in China 
He is just one several private drivers who have signed up with the ride hailing service in Beijing Each day Li picks up around 7 or 8 customers taking about 200 yuan US 32 from the rides altogether 
There are not enough taxis in the city so there s demand he said on Monday Uber is also much cheaper than taxis 
In China however not everyone is a fan of the service Last Thursday police reportedly raided Uber s office in the Chinese city of Guangzhou for letting private drivers operate without the needed qualifications according to local media reports 
Uber has said its cooperating with the authorities But the police raid could mean it will face more regulatory trouble in China as it tries to expand across the market 
Last week s raid wasn t exactly a surprise Back in January China s Ministry of Transport declared that private car owners or those without taxi licenses should be banned from using ride hailing apps 
In spite of the restriction Uber continues to operate This is partly because it works with licensed vehicle rental firms in China to sidestep the ban and deploy its drivers 
But in addition the company still offers a People s Uber service that lets private car owners connect with customers in need of a ride Uber declined to comment on whether the service might be shut down 
But Li a driver with People s Uber isn t worried 
It s a way for us to make money he said If the people support it then I think the government will give some room for Uber to exist 
The U S company has said that its People s Uber service is not for profit and that riders only pays drivers costs 
According to Li Uber also subsidizes drivers paying them an additional 10 yuan for each ride they make 
We aren t quite clear how Uber is making money from this he added 
But it s a good deal for consumers IDG News Service took one ride with Li and found it to be 10 yuan cheaper than the return ride with a Beijing taxi 
Whether this service will last will be up to Chinese regulators The government is expected to come up with clearer rules on the market which could mean Uber drivers will need certification to continue working said Mark Natkin managing director of Beijing based Marbridge Consulting 
Life is not easy for outsiders like Uber according to Zhang Xu an analyst with research firm Analysys International Historically foreign Internet companies have struggled in China he said But Uber could be different It has the support of Baidu 
That support arrived last year when Uber announced that China s leading search engine had become a strategic partner Baidu has much experience navigating China s strict rules on censorship and government regulations so the company could help Uber do the same 
If Uber did not have this investment from Baidu I would consider its position more precarious Natkin added It puts them in a better position from a regulatory standpoint but it s not bulletproof 
The country is also already saturated with local competition The country s two largest taxi hailing apps in China merged earlier this year and Uber itself still has a smaller presence that s been focused more on English speakers
