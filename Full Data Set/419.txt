Anyone applying for the job of England head coach would be crazy says former Australia opener Matthew Hayden 
Hayden s former team mates Jason Gillespie and Justin Langer are the favourites to succeed Peter Moores 
You re going to have no control whatsoever he said You are the man the establishment is going to kick 
Our Tune Kevin Andrew doomed affair could they ever get back together 
England are looking for a new coach to take over for the series against Australia in July with Paul Farbrace in temporary charge for this month s Tests against New Zealand 
However Moores successor will not be allowed to pick Pietersen because of what incoming director of cricket Andrew Strauss described as massive trust issues with the board 
Hayden who scored 30 centuries in 103 Tests for his country described Pietersen as one of Australia s greatest foes 
I think England are entering into a very dangerous space They have been in a perilous position for the last six months and they are going into very deep times now with an absolutely on fire New Zealand team and a really revengeful and very in form Australian team too 
There are going to be some really tough times ahead for England and they need to sort their back of office out quickly otherwise we are going to see England fall well behind in those Test rankings 
Gillespie and Hayden were Australia team mates from 1998 2006
