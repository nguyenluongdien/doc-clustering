Microsoft will soon offer three additional ways for enterprises to store data on Azure making the cloud computing platform more supportive of big data analysis 
The Azure SQL Data Warehouse available later this year will give organizations a way to store petabytes of data so it can be easily ingested by data analysis software such as the company s Power BI tool for data visualization the Azure Data Factory for data orchestration or the Azure Machine Learning service 
Unlike traditional in house data warehouse systems this cloud service can quickly be adjusted to fit the amount of data that actually needs to be stored Guthrie said Users can also specify the exact amount of processing power they ll need to analyze the data The service builds on the massively parallel processing architecture that Microsoft developed for its SQL Server database 
It allows you to store literally an infinite amount of data and it allows you to keep data in its original form Guthrie said The Data Lake uses Hadoop Distributed File System HDFS so it can be deployed by Hadoop or other big data analysis systems 
A preview of the Azure Data Lake will be available later this year 
It allows you to manage lots of databases at lower cost Guthrie said You can maintain completely isolated databases but allows you to aggregate all of the resources necessary to run those databases 
The new service would be particularly useful for running public facing software services where the amount of database storage needed can greatly fluctuate Today most Software as a Service SaaS offerings must overprovision their databases to accommodate the potential peak demand which can be financially wasteful The elastic option allows an organization to pool the available storage space for all of its databases in such a way that if one database rapidly grows it can pull unused space from other databases 
The new elastic pooling feature is now available in preview mode
