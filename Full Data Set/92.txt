Twitter failed to meet revenue estimates for the first quarter and is lowering its expectations for the rest of the year due to weaker than expected performance of some of its ads products the company said Tuesday 
The company s stock plummeted by nearly 20 percent toward the end of trading on Tuesday to around 42 Twitter typically publishes financial data after markets close but they appeared online apparently in error during the trading session 
Twitter still has not managed to turn a profit since it went public in 2013 The company posted a net loss of more than 162 million for the quarter down nearly 23 percent from the same period last year 
The poorly performing advertising products were a new feature for small and medium sized businesses to publish ads and a new analytics homepage for advertisers to track the success of their ads 
It s still early days for these products and we have a strong pipeline that we believe will drive increased value for direct response advertisers in the future CEO Dick Costolo said in a statement 
Twitter expects it revenue for the full year to be between 2 17 billion and 2 27 billion lower than the 2 3 billion to 2 35 billion it had been predicting for 2015 
To boost its advertising business Twitter announced alongside its results that it had entered into an agreement to acquire TellApart a marketing technology company that lets retailers and e commerce advertisers target potential customers across devices The technology could dovetail nicely with Twitter s growing efforts to let users buy retail items while on Twitter s site 
Twitter also announced a partnership with Google s DoubleClick advertising platform which Twitter said will help marketers measure their ad performance and manage their Twitter ads through the platform 
On an adjusted basis which excludes certain expenses Twitter s net earnings for the first quarter was 0 07 a share beating analyst estimates of 0 04 a share 
Twitter was more on target with its user count The company ended the quarter with 302 million users who log in monthly up 18 percent from the same period last year That s a gain of 14 million users from the previous quarter and in line with the company s own estimates 
Still Twitter s ability to attract and keep new users is a big challenge Without strong user growth its crucial advertising business is weakened and its ability to compete against Facebook Google and younger players like Snapchat is hampered At 302 million users Twitter is less than a quarter of the size of Facebook 
Over the past year the company has unleashed a flood of product updates aimed at making its service more useful and simplifying the sign up process for new users The company has began providing new users with feeds automatically personalized to them upon sign up and has started providing a recap of tweets missed when users sign back in Earlier this month Twitter redesigned its homepage to woo people without accounts filling it with curated feeds devoted to different topics like sports entertainment and technology Twitter hopes the new design which mimics the feeds people might see as users could entice people to sign up 
Video meanwhile can now be recorded using Twitter s mobile app The company even acquired Periscope a live streaming service that lets people record video on their smartphones and transmit it in real time on Twitter
