Barcelona reached their first Champions League final since 2011 despite Pep Guardiola s Bayern Munich salvaging pride in the return leg in Germany 
Barca levelled when Luis Suarez squared for a tap in from Neymar who drilled in after the pair combined again 
Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Muller both curled in as Bayern won on the night but Barca still progressed 
And the Spanish club s success means the tantalising prospect of an El Clasico showpiece against Real Madrid in the 6 June final in Berlin remains alive 
Bayern attempted 19 shots the highest tally recorded against Barca in the Champions League since Schalke in 2008 
Only Cristiano Ronaldo 38 and Lionel Messi 26 have scored more Champions League goals since start of 2012 13 than Robert Lewandowski 22 
Barcelona have reached their 18th European final an all time record 
Bayern stopped Barca equalling their record winning run of 10 straight Champions League victories 
Few outsiders had given German title winners Bayern any chance of overturning the visitors advantage after a clinical victory at the Nou Camp last Wednesday 
And ultimately they were proved right as the Spanish league leaders comfortably maintained their ambitions of a La Liga Champions League and Copa del Rey treble 
But Bayern were left wondering what might have been after wasting several chances and failing to keep out Barca s potent attack with some hazardous defending 
Guardiola s side had made the perfect start through Benatia s first Champions League goal The defender was allowed a free header to nod into the bottom left corner from 15 yards 
But the optimism that swept across the vast majority of the Allianz Arena lasted less than eight minutes 
However Bayern were guilty of naive defending as their early lead on the night was wiped out 
Lionel Messi s perfectly weighted pass allowed Suarez to run beyond the home defence before the Uruguayan unselfishly squared for team mate Neymar to roll in 
Bayern still encouraged by their vocal fans continued on the front foot and created several chances squandered most notably by Muller and Lewandowski 
But the tactic left them vulnerable and the Bundesliga champions were punished again on the half hour mark 
The home side were short of numbers defensively as Suarez and Neymar sprung forward with the former Liverpool striker again teeing up his team mate who had time and space to chest down and drill into the near corner 
That goal effectively killed off the tie leaving Bayern needing to become the first team since 1994 to score six times against Barca 
Barca who need one win from their final two matches to regain the Spanish title removed Suarez at the break after the striker complained of a tight hamstring and offered little attacking threat in the second half as Bayern fought back 
Lewandowski showed neat footwork to create space and precisely finish before Muller guided into the same bottom corner from 20 yards 
But it was too little too late as Barcelona moved within one victory of their fifth European crown 
Barca have lifted the European Cup on each of their last three final appearances in 2006 2009 and 2011
