If Colin Graves is a man of his word then there will soon be an inquiry under way at the England and Wales Cricket Board 
On Monday the BBC was refused the opportunity to ask Graves if an inquiry will indeed take place If it does what questions might he be asking 
Graves s mediocre comments resulted from the fact West Indies began the series five places lower than England in the world rankings and had not won a Test match against a team other than New Zealand Zimbabwe or Bangladesh since 2011 
In addition they were without a number of players including Chris Gayle Darren Sammy and Kieron Pollard because of their Indian Premier League commitments 
However under new coach Phil Simmons they looked like a side ready to re emerge as competitive on the world stage with BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew saying West Indies are not in any way a mediocre side they are a developing side
