The U S drone industry wants government regulations for private and commercial use of the remote controlled devices as a way to ensure airspace safety the head of a trade group says 
Many technology industries resist regulation but a regulated drone industry will create millions of dollars in economic activity and thousands of new jobs Wynne said Wynne s group however wants the FAA to allow some expanded uses of small drones including nighttime operations and flights outside the line of sight of drone operators 
How regulations shake out may largely depend on the actions of drone users said Jay Stanley senior policy analyst with the Speech Privacy and Technology Project at the American Civil Liberties Union 
There may be a huge clash coming between the drone industry and government agencies trying to protect public safety Stanley said This is an industry that s in the fetal stage of development so small things that happen at this stage could have lifetime effects he added If we see somebody put a gun on a drone and remotely start shooting people as a terrorist attack that may steer things 
Wynne said he s concerned about drone users intentionally violating regulations Misuse is misuse whether it s somebody who s had a little too much to drink at 3 o clock in the morning trying to impress their girlfriend and ending up on the president s lawn or real malintent he said 
The FAA received about 4 500 pubic comments in its small drone rule making proceeding as of Friday the comment deadline noted Robert Pappas special rules coordinator of the agency s UAS Integration Office In addition to the rule making the FAA is working as fast as it can to approve commercial drone requests before the rule making is final he said 
In addition to commercial regulations the U S government needs firm rules for law enforcement agencies using drones as surveillance tools the ACLU s Stanley said Drones have very powerful potential surveillance uses he said Aerial surveillance of cities on manned aircraft is already happening and it s likely coming to drones he said 
Aerial surveillance allows police to know where you work and where you live but also what friends and lovers you might be visiting at what hours what kinds of religious political sexually oriented establishments or meetings you go to he said Unfortunately we do have a long record of law enforcement giving into temptations to collect everything all the time about everybody just in case somebody engages in wrongdoing
