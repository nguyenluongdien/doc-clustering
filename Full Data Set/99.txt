EMC s VCE division wants to take the engineered systems approach it s honed with its Vblocks into next generation mobile and cloud applications 
On Monday it introduced the VCE VxRack System a hyperconverged platform designed to scale out to thousands of racks of computing and storage capacity Where Vblocks are designed to run traditional business applications like ERP enterprise resource planning VxRack is built for a new era 
The Vblock coverged architecture has been a success among customers looking to run traditional mission critical enterprise applications It was the founding product of VCE which was formed in 2009 as a joint venture among VMware Cisco Systems and EMC and it remains VCE s flagship the company s CEO Praveen Akkiraju said on Monday at EMC World where the VxRack System was announced 
The idea is to make it easier for enterprises and service providers to deploy new mobile and cloud applications VCE will build and support VxRacks the same way it does Vblocks with pre engineered factory made systems and a single source for support what the company calls the VCE experience 
This is not something that you re going to have to go and engineer yourself Akkiraju said 
In addition VxRacks will work with the VCE Vscale Architecture and VCE Vision software so they can be included along with Vblocks in unified data centers that span multiple locations 
VxRacks will come in two flavors The first orderable starting in July will give customers a choice of hypervisors including VMware vSphere KVM or a bare metal approach and use Cisco Nexus top of rack switches for networking A later version will use an integrated VMware software stack based on EVO Rack technology a larger scale version of VMware s EVO Rail and VMware Virtual SAN More details on that product will come out at the VMworld conference in late August EMC says 
The systems will be built from commodity hardware modules two rack units in height that can be combined into configurations as small as one quarter rack and as large as thousands of racks Users will be able to scale out storage and computing independently as their needs change VCE says 
The underlying ScaleIO technology is best suited to big cloud service providers with a few applications rather than enterprises doing general virtualization said Stuart Miniman a senior analyst at Wikibon VCE has the traditional enterprise side covered but wants to be able to handle newer applications at large scale Few customers are using VBlocks for new types of workloads like Hadoop or NoSQL he said because they re looking for cheap scalable distributed storage Miniman said 
Up against smaller hyperconverged rivals such as Nutanix and Simplivity VCE can set itself apart with its size and one stop shop approach he said They give you a warm hug with their services
