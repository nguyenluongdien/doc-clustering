Microsoft plans to appeal a EU court ruling that found its Skype brand is too similar to that of British satellite broadcaster Sky which holds a European trademark on audiovisual goods telephony and software related services categories 
On Tuesday the General Court of the EU found the Skype name and logo could not be registered as trademarks because they can be confused with Sky s 
Skype had sought to overturn decisions by Europe s trademark registry the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market OHIM that also found confusion was likely 
Microsoft which bought Skype in 2011 said it would continue the legal fight We re confident no confusion exists between these brands and services and will appeal This decision does not require us to alter product names in any way a Microsoft spokeswoman said in an email 
Skype applied to register the word SKYPE and its logo as an EU wide trademark in 2004 and 2005 in several categories These applications were opposed by Sky shortly after arguing they would cause confusion with the word mark SKY that it filed for identical goods and services in 2003 
Conceptually the figurative element conveys no concept except perhaps that of a cloud which would further increase the likelihood of the element sky being recognized within the word element skype for clouds are to be found in the sky and thus may readily be associated with the word sky it added 
Moreover confusion with Sky s word mark is also likely because the pronunciation of the vowel y is similar in the words skype and sky The word sky is part of the basic vocabulary of the English language and remains clearly identifiable in the word skype although the latter is written as only one word the court said 
A Sky spokesman said the company s intention all along has been to protect the Sky brand
