The season opening Australian Grand Prix has been pushed back two weeks in 2016 organisers have announced 
The race on 3 April will mean the latest start to a Formula 1 season since 1988 when the Brazilian GP was held on the same date 
Organisers of the race in Melbourne s Albert Park said the event would have an earlier start time than recently 
Moving the event back will compress the F1 calendar which in 2015 has a number of large gaps between races 
Most noticeable among these are three weeks between the most recent race in Bahrain and the next in Spain on 10 May 
And as a result of the cancellation of the German race on 17 July only one grand prix the Hungarian on 26 July takes place between the British event on 5 July and the Belgian on 23 August 
The Australian race had been moved to late afternoon in recent years to boost television viewing figures in Europe 
But as the 2016 event will take place after the start of Australian daylight saving time later into the Antipodean autumn the 17 00 or 16 00 local start time that has been usual will no longer work 
However it is typical for race dates to be moved a number of times between the first iteration of the calendar for any given year and the final confirmed list of dates
