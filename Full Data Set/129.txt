A Spanish judge has ordered Barcelona Football Club to stand trial over claims it tried to mislead tax authorities 
The club bought the Brazilian player Neymar in 2013 for what they said was 57m euros 41m 65m 
But a judge in Madrid said he believes the club knew the fee was far higher and so more tax should have been paid 
The club s current and former presidents have 10 days to respond to the court 
Barcelona and its former president Sandro Rosell have previously denied wrongdoing 
The club said it paid 57m for Neymar 23 with his parents receiving 45m of the fee 
But investigators allege that the fee for Neymar s transfer from Brazilian team Santos was closer to 83m 
As a result Barcelona has not paid about 13m in tax say prosecutors 
The Spanish news agency Efe said the club could face a fine of more than 22m if found guilty 
All parties have 10 days to file papers in their defence before the court No trial date has yet been fixed
