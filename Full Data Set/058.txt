Microsoft has upgraded an IT management portal it s developing for Azure that s intended to calm the nerves of IT pros wary about moving on premises applications to the vendor s cloud 
The navigation improvements are meant to simplify how users find Azure resources For example the all resources view will display a list of items such as web apps and virtual machines that customers own across all their subscriptions The resources are sorted alphabetically and can be filtered by different criteria although Microsoft acknowledges the list isn t complete an issue it s working to fix 
The company has also made it possible to customize the columns in this list and pin extra important resources to tiles on the opening page the so called Startboard for quick access 
The interface upgrades let users customize monitoring charts and make it easier to use keyboard shortcuts If a tile can t be rendered there is now a feature for refreshing that individual tile without having to reload the entire portal 
As enterprises move more and larger IT systems to the cloud advanced management functionality is becoming increasingly important to IT pros so that they can monitor and control to a certain extent their hosted apps computing services and data Gradually service providers like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft are adding new features to make the IT management capabilities they offer to their customers more efficient and wider in scope 
The portal is only available as a preview and the blog post didn t offer any details on when it would be generally available But Microsoft seems to have stepped up the development of the offering It has been upgraded three times since the end January and more improvements are on the way
