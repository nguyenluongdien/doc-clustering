Five telecom trade groups and two broadband providers have asked the U S Federal Communications Commission to put a hold on net neutrality rules it recently approved 
Seeking a partial stay of the FCC s rules are trade groups USTelecom CTIA the National Cable and Telecommunications Association the American Cable Association and the Wireless Internet Service Providers Association as well as ISPs AT T and CenturyLink The groups asked the FCC Friday to put a hold on its decision to reclassify broadband as a regulated common carrier service but the requests do not affect the commission s rules that prohibit blocking throttling and paid prioritization 
The new stay request targets the provisions of the net neutrality order that would directly impact consumers specifically imposition of common carrier obligations that will increase costs and chill development of new and innovative services USTelecom President Walter McCormick said in a statement We are not seeking to stay the bright line rules prohibiting blocking throttling or paid prioritization but as we have previously said the commission s reclassification of Internet access was the wrong approach to implementing these standards 
An FCC spokeswoman declined to comment on the stay requests
