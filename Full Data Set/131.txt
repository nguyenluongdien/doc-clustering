The 68th Cannes Film Festival kicks off this year not with a Hollywood feature but rather a French drama directed by Emmanuelle Bercot 
Her film La Tete Haute starring Catherine Deneuve gives Bercot the dubious honour of being the first woman to open Cannes since Diane Kurys in 1987 
In fact it s rather a defiantly European slate of films in competition for the Palme d Or including directors Paolo Sorrentino Nanni Moretti and Yorgos Lanthimos in the running 
That s not to say Cannes will be without A list powerhouse stars with Tom Hardy Charlize Theron and Michael Fassbender among those expected on the red carpet 
Over the next week we ll have more of the daily goings on at the world s biggest and oldest film festival 
Managed to see last night s opening film at Cannes the French drama La Tete Haute or Standing Tall in English 
Directed by Emmanuelle Bercot and starring Catherine Deneuve and first time actor Rod Paradot it tells the story of a young delinquent and the exhaustive attempts by the local authorities to help him curb his anti social behaviour which revolves mainly around bunking off school and stealing cars 
Deneuve is a steely yet kind hearted juvenile court judge perhaps the one authority figure who can get through to the volatile and violent teenager 
In Paradot there is a refreshing un actorly performance often raw and explosive and he exudes cockiness and vulnerability in equal measure However the untethered performance of an amateur performer brings its own problem as there is little to show in the way of character development permanently rooted as he is in the role of angry teenager 
The drama often relies on the procedural with frequent expository explanations of how the French juvenile system works His mildly drug addicted mother is also something of a stereotype 
That fact this was selected as the opening film for this year s Cannes however over a Hollywood crowd pleaser is not to be overlooked 
Perhaps still stinging from the vicious reviews for last year s Grace of Monaco and the lukewarn reaction to The Great Gatsby a year earlier the festival organisers are putting a French stamp on Cannes 
And Standing Tall though not a perfect film was certainly an admirable choice on their part 
Think Point Break an undercover thriller but without Patrick Swayze amazing action sequences and surfing set it in France over a century ago and you re in the right ballpark for the film The Anarchists 
It stars two actors who both made a splash at previous Cannes festivals 
Tahar Rahim whose blistering performance in A Prophet made him one of Europe s hottest talents stars as Jean a lowly policeman in 1899 Paris sent by his senior officer to infiltrate a gang of anarchists bent on ending the subjugation of the poor working classes by destroying the bourgeois 
There he is inevitably drawn in to the close inner circle of the band s passionate leader and his beautiful girlfriend played by Adele Exarchopoulos who shared the Palme d Or award at Cannes with Lea Seydoux and director Abdellatif Kechiche for the explicit lesbian love story Blue is the Warmest Colour 
Jean s loyalties are tested and he is torn between his duty to serve his growing friendship with Elisee and his feelings for Judith 
The grimy underbelly of working class Paris is well recreated and the performances are strong It moves a little slowly in places but the stakes are high as the conclusion moves towards the planning of a violent attack 
What is perhaps a little disappointing is that for a group calling themselves anarchists actual anarchy is in short supply These would be rebels prefer instead to sit about drinking and musing on whether social change should ever justify violence 
There is a bank heist which naturally ends with a casualty like I said Point Break but definitely not as slick as the Ex Presidents But at least they too never go for the vault 
The film is screening as part of the critics fortnight strand There s a lot there to like but I was frustrated at a lack of genuine suspense Like Jean I was torn 
Every once in a while a film comes along which is just a little bit different than everything else you will see at Cannes 
Such is the case with the new film by Italian director Matteo Garrone This is his first film in the English language and his first in the realm of fantasy 
Tale of Tales is a twisted fairytale portmanteau of three separate stories which nevertheless are also finely connected 
Based on the stories of the 17th Century writer Giambattista Basile this is a world of sea monsters and ogres witches and magic 
One story tells the tale of a lustful king who mistakes the voice of old crone for that of a young girl and goes all out to woo her Another tells of a distracted monarch who is more obsessed by his pet flea than the daughter he is about to marry off to a mindless giant 
Salma Hayek plays an obsessed queen whose desire for a child robs her of everything else she holds dear 
It s an all star cast with appearances from the likes of Toby Jones Vincent Cassel and John C Reilly Much has been made of Garrone s foray into English perhaps to broaden his appeal beyond Europe s borders But the film has such a defiantly European sensibility that it s a risky move by the director who may alienate his existing audience 
However it s lavish beautifully realised and darkly funny 
An interesting proposition this morning is a film screening as part of the critics fortnight The Anarchists stars Tahar Rahim who made his name in the film A Prophet and Adele Exarchopoulos who shared the best actress title with Lea Seydoux for Blue is the Warmest Colour at Cannes two years ago 
Set in Paris in 1899 the period drama tells the story of a humble police corporal sent to infiltrate a group of anarchists who finds his loyalties tested when he falls in love with one of them 
So we begin this morning whisked off in people carriers with tinted windows to the impossibly glamorous and exclusive Hotel du Cap about 30 minutes outside of Cannes to meet the director and cast of the post apocalyptic Mad Max Fury Road 
Sadly there was no grand entrance through the hotel lobby instead we were taken around the back of the building through the tradesmen s entrance as it were 
Luckily any fears of feeling a little bit like a dirty secret were allayed by the youthful enthusiasm of the film s 70 year old director George Miller It s been 35 years since he first burst onto the screen with Mad Max and its then unknown star Mel Gibson 
Mel sat beside me at the premiere with Tom Hardy sat behind us and Mel is one of those people who can t censor himself I kept seeing him chuckle 
He s directing a movie in Australia now and would ask Oh who s that actor He really loved it and it meant a lot to me and he gave me a hug 
He s a great film maker and I know he s had awful problems but he s a really good man struggling with his demons I got his respect as a film maker which was great 
Hardy stars as the largely silent Max while Nicholas Hoult plays war boy Nux a devoted follower of the movie s bad guy Immortan Joe 
The original film was already more than a decade old by the time Hoult was born and he admits he d never seen it before he auditioned for the part 
I had seen George s other films like Happy Feet but I was amazed that no one had told me about them 
But then all these pop culture references made more sense to me watching Tupac and Dr Dre s California video and seeing this is where all of those guys got their ideas from 
Hardy s first exposure to the violent films was a little more damaging he says 
I was about six or seven and I saw my cousins watching it and it was just weird because I was young and it s quite grown up 
It s very unusual and I didn t understand it a bit like the first time I heard Jimi Hendrix as a kid it was too grown up for me 
I felt a little bit dirty and a little bit abused and I kind of left it because it s odd Then later when I was about 15 I knew about it I knew about the character and the Interceptor Max s power V8 engine car but I still had never seen it 
I got a dog called Mad Max when I was 17 and I didn t like the name because I remember the film and it was weird So I changed his name and he died the year I was offered Max and then I watched the movie and then I got it 
That would make his dog about 20 when he died which is pretty old 
Charlize Theron Imperator Furiosa in the movie arrived with a glass of tomato juice which could have been mistakenly identified by yours truly as a Bloody Mary 
No this is virgin all the way she insists There are too many studio people about I don t want to get fired 
The film surprisingly has a strong feminist streak Her character is to put it simply a bit of a bad ass not to be messed with she drives a massive rig called the War Machine and is central to the film s plot 
More importantly she is not there to serve out a romantic storyline between her character and Max 
You can t say the stakes are this high and you re literally in a driving war and we cannot stop because if we stop we die and then have them pull off to the side of the road to have sex like fall in love because then immediately the anxiety has been relieved for the audience 
Unfortunately some film makers think you can have both What was great about this is that the luxury of a love story was not where we were I mean they can t even talk to each other 
We never even talked about it it was never there no one said maybe we never had to fight against it 
It was always going to be two warriors on par starting off with very little respect for each other and ending up with a massive respect for each other 
You know it s going to be a Cannes Film Festival of excitement and unpredictability when on arriving at the airport in Nice you spot in no particular order Charlize Theron John Legend and former This Is Your Life host Michael Aspel 
I should add they didn t all arrive together Which would have been weird 
The festival itself kicks off later not with a Hollywood movie but rather a French drama Standing Tall directed by Emanuelle Bercot Perhaps the organisers have learned a lesson after the lukewarm reception given to Baz Luhrmann s The Great Gatsby in 2013 and the all out pasting meted out to last year s opening movie Grace of Monaco 
Or maybe it was just a great opportunity to open the oldest and most French of film festivals with a local tale starring the first lady of French cinema Catherine Deneuve 
Either way there is a lot of excitement ahead of the first opening film at Cannes to be directed by a woman since 1987 
Theron is of course here for the screening of Mad Max Fury Road in which she stars with Tom Hardy He s taken on the iconic role first played by Mel Gibson more than 30 years ago 
Aimed squarely at petrolheads and Fast and Furious fiends the film nevertheless has a strong feminist streak slicing through the male machismo 
There is some truly astounding stunt work on the chase scenes filmed in a north African desert and the cinematography is incredible And it has souped up cars and trucks lots of them All very powerful and very very loud 
Bercot s drama about a French delinquent seems almost sedate by comparison 
Which one is Mr Aspel looking forward to most
