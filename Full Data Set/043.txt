Hitachi Data Systems is aiming its big data expertise at health care and enterprise IT departments with specialized products for combining types of information 
HDS wants to help organizations in specific realms put together data they ve never combined before to gain new insights and share knowledge with more participants It s already introduced products for health public safety and telecommunications network analytics 
On Tuesday at Hitachi Connect in Las Vegas HDS announced a system for analyzing data about enterprise IT operations and updated its health care analytics platform with mobile access 
Hitachi Live Insight for IT Operations is a software and service solution for combining all the machine to machine data from an enterprise data center so the IT department can maintain high availability The product can analyze information from applications storage systems power supplies temperature sensors and other components to determine the root cause of a problem that may affect multiple systems 
Live Insight is focused on HDS s own products but can collect and analyze data from multiple vendors systems using standard IT reporting formats such as SNMP Simple Network Management Protocol said Bob Madaio senior director of product marketing Software from Sumo Logic compiles the diverse sets of data and a cloud based Hitachi service performs the analytics 
The system is designed to find the causes of slowdowns and other problems that are less than catastrophic as well as analyzing failures that take down applications and systems 
Also on Tuesday HDS introduced the latest version of its Hitachi Clinical Repository HCR for Connected Health which for the first time lets users view its data on mobile devices 
HCR introduced in 2012 aggregates information from health care systems such as MRIs magnetic resonance imaging machines that come from different vendors and use different data formats The data from those systems used to reside in silos and HCR puts it in one virtual platform spanning multiple caregivers where all the information is searchable and discoverable through the same interface 
Starting with the new release users will be able to access HCR from Android and iOS phones and tablets To secure sensitive health data and help users comply with regulations all HCR data can be wiped from the mobile device as soon as it s turned off HDS said 
Both products will be available by the end of June HDS said
