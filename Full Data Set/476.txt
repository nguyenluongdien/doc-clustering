So how was it for you Four stroke victories achieved wire to wire can often make for relatively dull tournaments but not at the 2015 Masters 
The Green Jackets won t like this was a familiar observation as Spieth collected nine birdies en route to becoming the youngest Augusta first round leader in history After all the popular but errant theory is that major championship golf is supposed to provide a more exacting test 
Yet mother nature with its spring rains in the build up to the Masters and overnight showers during the tournament did everyone a favour The course remained gettable and for that we should feel thankful 
With the greens softer more receptive and a fraction slower than expected we were able to witness a true golfing spectacle 
Spieth fully capitalised with a record 28 birdies during four thrilling rounds in which he became the first player to reach the dizzying heights of 19 under par 
BBC Radio 5 live s commentary referenced what seemed an invisible force field that helped keep golf s most sacred statistical landmarks intact 
When Spieth threatened his first round 62 a bogey at the par five 15th suddenly materialised to dash the opportunity 
On Sunday evening his sound putting touch deserted him at the last to ensure the champion didn t lower Tiger Woods s record 18 under 
The difference between Woods s record tally in 1997 and this is that Tiger s was so freakish it earned him a 12 stroke victory Spieth s winning margin was just four strokes 
With their 14 under par tallies runners up Justin Rose and Phil Mickelson would have posted the winning score in all bar five of the previous 78 Masters that have been played 
The top 32 players finished under par yet there seemed no devaluing of the currency of birdies and eagles Instead it felt as though we were being treated to an exhibition of golfing excellence 
Phil Mickelson and Justin Rose s mark of 14 under would have won 12 of the last 13 Masters
