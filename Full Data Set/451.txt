Red Bull say they will pull out of Formula 1 if they cannot get a competitive engine or Audi do not join forces with the team 
Motorsport adviser Helmut Marko said Red Bull were interested in doing a deal that would see Audi enter F1 
If we don t have a competitive engine in the near future then either Audi is coming or we are out said Marko 
But he denied Red Bull had already been in formal talks with the German company which is part of the Volkswagen Group 
Marko told BBC Sport There are so many rumours Officially there was no request or talks The VW Group first has to sort out who will be the new chief of support who will run the brand of VW and when they have sorted all these things maybe then they can think about what they are doing in motorsport 
I was on the phone but not to the people you think 
Like all teams Red Bull have a contractual commitment to race in F1 until 2020 They also have a contract with Renault at least until the end of the 2016 season 
Marko s remarks are a reference to a power struggle taking place at the very top of the VW Group which also has Porsche Lamborghini Bugatti Skoda and Seat among its brands 
Helmut Marko has been rumoured to be in talks with Audi
