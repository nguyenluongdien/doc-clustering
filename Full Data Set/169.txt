The second in command of Islamic State IS has been killed in a US led coalition air strike in northern Iraq the Iraqi ministry of defence says 
Abdul Rahman Mustafa Mohammed also known as Abu Alaa al Afari was at a mosque near Tal Afar that was targeted spokesman Brig Gen Tahsin Ibrahim said 
However the US military later denied coalition planes had attacked a mosque 
In recent weeks there were unconfirmed reports that Afari had taken temporary charge of IS operations 
Gen Ibrahim told the BBC that Afari was killed alongside dozens of militants who he had been meeting at the al Shuhada Martyrs mosque in the village of al Iyadhiya near Tal Afar where he was reportedly a well known preacher 
Tal Afar in the northern province of Nineveh was seized by IS in June 2014 
The general did not specify which country had carried out the air strike but the US has been responsible for the vast majority since the coalition campaign began last August 
The Governor of Nineveh Atheel al Nujaifi told the BBC in Washington that his contacts had confirmed Afari s death 
The US led coalition said on Wednesday it had carried out a strike in the Tal Afar area against an Isil IS fighting position and an Isil heavy machine gun adding We can confirm that coalition aircraft did not strike a mosque 
Adding to the confusion the Iraqi interior ministry was quoted as saying that although Afari was present at the scene of the air strike it wasn t clear what had happened to him 
The Iraqi government has previously announced the deaths of IS leaders only for them to resurface alive 
But the BBC s Ahmed Maher in Baghdad says that if Afari s death is confirmed it would represent another blow to IS which has suffered a series of losses on the battlefield in recent months 
The man known as Abu Alaa al Afari is believed to rank number two to IS leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi and commensurately has the highest US bounty on his head 7m apart from Baghdadi himself 10m 
The Iraqi authorities continue to insist that Baghdadi himself was incapacitated and had handed operational control to Afari after being badly wounded in an earlier strike something the Pentagon has denied 
There have been many previous announcements from Baghdad during its long struggle against the Islamist militants which have not been subsequently borne out So many observers will be sceptical of this latest claim until it is bolstered by independent confirmation 
Born in 1957 or 1959 in Iraq s second city of Mosul Qaduli joined IS forces in Syria after his release from an Iraqi prison in 2012 it said He had previously served as the leader of al Qaeda in Iraq AQI a precursor of IS in Mosul 
The US added Qaduli to its list of specially designated global terrorists in 2014
