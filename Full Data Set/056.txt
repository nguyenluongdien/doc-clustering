Microsoft has signaled that it may take a massive write off of its Nokia acquisition perhaps as early as July 
With revenue at 1 4 billion for the period Microsoft said cost of revenue exceeded sales by 4 million meaning the company lost about 12 cents even before marketing R D and other expenses were factored in on each phone sold 
More importantly Microsoft also warned investors that it may need to write off some of the Nokia acquisition 
Given its recent performance the Phone Hardware reporting unit is at an elevated risk of impairment Microsoft said using a term to describe the situation when the market value of a business is less than what s carried on the books In such scenarios corporations are required to balance accounts by taking a charge against earnings to the tune of the difference 
Microsoft currently carries 5 46 billion in goodwill from the Nokia acquisition on its books as well as another 4 51 billion in intangible assets The Redmond Wash company had attributed the Nokia goodwill to increased synergies that are expected to be achieved from the integration of NDS Nokia Corp s Devices and Services business 
That value may now be greatly overstated Microsoft acknowledged 
The valuation of acquired assets and liabilities including goodwill resulting from the acquisition of NDS is reflective of the enterprise value based on the long term financial forecast for the Phone Hardware business the firm said in last Thursday s 10 Q In this highly competitive and volatile market it is possible that we may not realize our forecast 
It also admitted that its phone business was in trouble In the third quarter of fiscal year 2015 Phone Hardware did not meet its sales volume and revenue goals and the mix of units sold had lower margins than planned the company stated 
During a Thursday conference call with Wall Street Microsoft s CFO Amy Hood did not mention the possible write off of the Nokia investment but said that the company was reducing costs in the division She also told analysts that an earlier forecast to reach break even on phones in fiscal year 2016 which starts July 1 was at risk 
That said the changing mix of our portfolio to the value segment and the significant negative headwind from currency exchange rates will impact our ability to reach operational break even in FY16 Hood said 
The write off had been preceded with a warning similar to that issued last week for Nokia although Microsoft s phrasing then was more cautious about the possibility of an impending charge For example it did not use the words elevated risk of impairment at that time as it did in the recent 10 Q about the Nokia investment 
Among our reporting units the fair value of OSD has been the closest to its carrying value and is most sensitive to changes in assumptions Microsoft said in March 2012 referring to its then Online Services Division OSD where the aQuantive acquisition had been placed We will continue to monitor OSD as we complete our annual planning process and evaluate results 
Three months later Microsoft announced the 6 2 billion write off 
Outwardly Microsoft has remained bullish about its device business but last week even CEO Satya Nadella hinted at underlying problems 
We continue to demonstrate momentum in the value smartphone segment of the phone market driving 18 growth in Lumia volume this quarter Nadella said last week However we need to take further action to reduce our costs across devices as we execute on our Windows 10 first party hardware plans 
Microsoft does its impairment calculations annually at the beginning of May If it wrote down part or all of the 5 46 billion in goodwill related to the Nokia acquisition it would do so in the current quarter which ends June 30 and probably announce it in July either at or before its next scheduled earnings call with Wall Street
