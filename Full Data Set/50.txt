Intel is becoming a little more diverse just several months after announcing an ambitious plan to add more women and minority workers to its ranks 
Since January roughly 17 percent of Intel s senior hires were historically under represented minorities about double the rate last year Intel also doubled its senior hiring among women to 33 percent CEO Brian Krzanich said on Wednesday 
More broadly roughly 41 percent of Intel s hires for the year so far have been diverse he said without specifying further That s up from about 30 percent a year ago Krzanich said He gave the figures during a talk at the Push Tech 2020 Summit in San Francisco an event focused on diversity issues in the technology industry 
The ramp up in diverse hiring has occurred throughout the company including the engineering human resources and finance departments Intel has roughly 106 000 employees 
Krzanich also said Intel would invest 5 million over the next five years in the Oakland Unified School District in California for an program to teach computer science and engineering Intel hopes to get students ready for college and prepare them for careers in the technology industry 
The education program also includes an internship component students who complete it will be guaranteed jobs at Intel Krzanich said 
Oakland s school district about 40 miles from Intel s headquarters in Santa Clara is 65 percent black and Hispanic he said 
Krzanich delivered his remarks in front of a racially mixed group of hundreds of tech workers from both large companies like Apple and Microsoft and smaller startups and nonprofits 
We ve made a huge amount of progress he said What we want is a workforce that s diverse and represents the community we re trying to serve with our technology 
Since announcing the plan Intel has begun to gather new data about its hiring processes which the company tracks weekly In addition the company has begun to tie managers and other employees pay to Intel s progress toward its diversity goals 
Later this summer Intel will announce a new effort within its venture capital arm to better support diversity in technology Krzanich said without giving further details
