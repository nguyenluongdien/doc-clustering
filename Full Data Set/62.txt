Two new IT management products from Microsoft continue the company s push to help customers move their operations to the cloud 
The Microsoft Azure Stack software collection combines the Azure infrastructure and platform services so they can be used for an enterprise s internal operations Meanwhile the Microsoft Operations Management Suite is for managing workloads across different cloud services including those running on Azure Amazon Web Services Windows Server Linux VMware and OpenStack 
The Azure Stack will make it possible to have Azure in your data center making it consistent with the public Azure said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella at the opening of the Ignite conference for IT professionals being held this week in Chicago 
The company also announced Windows Server 2016 and System Center 2016 the next versions of the company s server software and system management software 
The Microsoft Azure Stack can be used to manage virtualized instances of Microsoft software such as SQL Server SharePoint and Exchange using the Azure Resource Manager software It features a number of security technologies to isolate workloads from one another while still offering the ability to manage them from a central console 
The Microsoft Operations Management Suite OMS centralizes the management of workloads across different systems It can be used to manage both virtual machines and Docker like containers so they can be easily moved across different cloud services either internal or public clouds 
OMS handles log analysis offering the ability to search through millions of log files to troubleshoot problems It can manage system updates for Microsoft software and collect information on security related events It provides a way to set up disaster recovery operations where resources can be moved to another data center in times of a regional emergency 
The second technical preview of System Center 2016 will be issued this week giving administrators more details of the new features of the system management software The software s support for Linux has been improved It now can monitor LAMP Linux Apache MySQL and Perl Python PHP stacks as well as SSH Secure Shell The company s mode for managing large number of servers called Desired State Configuration DSC will work with Linux 
System Center 2016 will also feature improved support for other Microsoft products as well including Azure Office 365 SQL Server and Exchange 
Windows Server 2016 will offer the Azure Service Fabric software that will help organizations scale up their applications to meet heavy demands This is the same software that Microsoft itself uses to run highly scalable services like the Cortana personal assistant service 
The second technical preview of Windows Server 2016 also available this week will give users the first chance to look at the Nano Server build the stripped down version of Windows Server to run containers
