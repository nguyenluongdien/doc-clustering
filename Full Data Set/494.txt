Several lengthy matches on Wednesday night forced the late start of Murray s second round victory 
Murray s 6 4 3 6 6 0 win finished at 03 00 and he is due to face Spain s Marcel Granollers on Thursday evening 
The scheduling issues in Madrid were unfortunate said ATP Tour chief executive Chris Kermode 
Kermode admitted that players starting after 1am were at a disadvantage but that scheduling involved juggling the interests of players promoters ticket holders TV broadcasters and media 
While such instances are rare we will look at reducing the risk of similar instances occurring in the future Kermode added
