Google will give 150 million US 163 million to European publishers and digital journalism startups in the next three years as part of a wider package that aims to support the news sector 
The Internet giant has had a difficult relationship with publishers in many countries in Europe over using snippets for its news indexing but having eight top publishers joining its initiative may soften up other publishers to also do a deal 
The move is part of a deal between Google and eight of Europe s biggest news publishers who together launched the Digital News Initiative on Tuesday Among the backers are U K publishers the Financial Times and the Guardian German publishers Die Zeit and Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung and French publisher Les Echos 
Notably missing from the list though are Germany s Axel Springer as well as the publications of News Corp which runs several U K newspapers including The Sun and The Times Other media companies are welcome to join the initiative D Asaro Biondo said 
An Axel Springer spokeswoman said the company is still assessing if joining is an option Neither The Sun nor The Times responded immediately to a request for comment 
However this initiative won t head off the Commission s antitrust probe nor should it said Danker adding that there are clearly legitimate questions about dominance that Google will need to answer 
Besides giving 150 million to new media initiatives Google said it will hire staff based in Paris Hamburg and London to work with newsrooms on digital skills Together with publishers Google will also set up a working group focusing on ads video apps data insights paid for journalism and Google News to increase revenue traffic and audience engagement 
Google will also fund research into the changing media landscape focusing on news consumption and user behavior across Europe as well as research into computer assisted reporting and crowdsourcing information
