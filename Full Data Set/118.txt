Australia s opposition parties are preparing for a possible early election in the wake of the stimulatory budget 
However the government has denied it delivered a generous budget in a bid to win the public s approval 
The budget delivered on Tuesday night put money in the pocket of most Australians 
It stands in stark contrast to the government s 2014 debut budget which slashed government spending and saw the government s popularity sink 
Prime Minister Tony Abbott on Wednesday denied speculation now circulating among his own MPs that he would call an election later this year 
The coalition won power in September 2013 and under Australia s electoral rules another election would be called in the second half of 2016 
Mr Abbott said his government always planned to run full term 
That is what the people of Australia elected us to do he told local media 
To govern the country as best we could to deliver on our commitments as best we could for a full three years he said 
Opposition Labor leader Bill Shorten tweeted that the budget was a political fix to save Mr Abbott s job and said the Labor Party was ready for an early election 
He has said his party would vote against savings measures intended to pay for some of the benefits offered by the budget to families 
Independent senator Nick Xenophon agreed and cast doubt on the government s ability to deliver everything it promised in the new budget 
There s no way we will get there they are rubbery figures Mr Xenophon said of the budget estimates 
I think they re trying to repair their traditional supporter base and I think the government is keeping its options open for an election later this year he told the ABC 
Newly elected Greens leader Richard di Natale said his team was ready for an early election 
I say to Treasurer Joe Hockey bring it on any time he said 
The budget outlined a savings and expenditure programme the government said would reduce the budget deficit from an actual deficit of A 41 1bn 33bn 21bn in the 2014 2015 financial year to an estimated A 7bn by 2018 19 
Among other things the budget increased childcare subsidies to many parents reversed earlier plans to slow the growth in pension payments and dumped a proposal to make young people wait six months before they could receive unemployment benefits 
It also launched a A 5 5bn package to support small business which included cutting the tax on small business profits to 28 5 from 30 
Consumer group CHOICE said some consumers would be better off but others would be hit hard 
The changes announced are complex and will affect different households in very different ways said CHOICE Chief executive officer Alan Kirkland 
The Australian Council of Social Services ACOSS was pleased some of last year s divisive and unfair budget had been dropped 
The pension changes youth employment strategy and higher investment in child care show the way forward and are a welcome change of direction reducing the budget deficit without creating a fairness deficit said ACOSS chief executive officer Cassandra Goldie
