Amazon has finally shared some numbers about its cloud business and not surprisingly they show that it s thriving and profitable 
Amazon Web Services brought in 1 566 billion in net sales for Amazon s first quarter it said Thursday up 49 percent from 1 05 billion AWS generated the same time a year ago For this quarter AWS netted a profit of 265 million up from 245 million a year ago 
AWS is a 5 billion business and still growing fast in fact it s accelerating Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos was quoted as saying in a press release He also called the group an example of how we approach ideas and risk taking at Amazon 
AWS now generates nearly 7 percent of Amazon s total revenue Overall Amazon s net sales for the quarter which ended March 31 totaled 22 7 billion up 15 percent from the 19 7 billion collected in the same period a year earlier The company posted a net loss of 57 million in this first quarter down from the 108 million it lost in last year s first quarter 
Thursday s earnings release marks the first time since the launch of its cloud service nine years ago that Amazon has broken out AWS quarterly revenue 
Previously it has lumped sales from its rapidly growing cloud business in the category of North America Other which also included revenue from other sources such as a co branded credit card Analysts and media have assumed that the vast majority of revenue from this category came from cloud operations In the fourth quarter of 2014 that category generated 1 67 billion in sales for AWS up from 1 17 billion a year earlier
