When Facebook expanded into a new campus in late March the company released a stunning aerial photo of the site captured from a drone In taking the picture Facebook almost certainly broke two FAA regulations governing drone use 
The social network isn t alone in its carelessness Drone use has taken off quickly among both businesses and individuals and many people even sophisticated technology companies apparently are not fully aware of the rules 
The Facebook image was captured by a DJI drone at what appears to be several hundred feet above a corner of its new campus in Menlo Park California The building sits about 2 miles from Palo Alto Airport easily within the 5 mile zone in which drone operators must obtain permission from an airport before conducting a flight 
Palo Alto Airport s air traffic control tower said it received no such request or notification of the flight 
Even if it had current FAA regulations also prohibit any commercial use of drones unless a company has obtained a waiver and Facebook isn t among the handful of companies that have 
Asked about the image Facebook said the photos were taken for non commercial use on our property But the FAA is clear that only flights conducted for purely hobby purposes are permitted without a waiver Whether the flight is over public or private land is irrelevant 
There s confusion around the use of drones to shoot video as well The FAA recently said it won t go after people who post drone flights on YouTube and collect advertising money from the site Some had worried that would constitute commercial use 
But conversely flights conducted by businesses aren t non commercial just because no money changes hands 
A lawyer specializing in drone rules said she advises clients to be extremely conservative about how they conduct flights while the FAA is considering new longer term rules 
Perhaps as a result of the confusion the list of illicit drone flights is getting longer by the week 
For every flight that is noticed it s likely that many take place that don t attract attention 
Indeed Bedwell Bayfront Park near Facebook s campus is a popular weekend location for Silicon Valley drone enthusiasts despite its proximity to both Palo Alto and San Carlos airports Some YouTube videos show drones flying from the park to over 3 000 feet much higher than permitted and close to the altitude of jets on approach paths to nearby San Francisco International Airport
