Best Buy said its customers could start using Apple Pay from Monday to make purchases on its app through the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus thus appearing to break ranks with a group of leading U S merchants who are backing an alternative payment system 
Best Buy could not be immediately reached for comment on whether it would support both CurrentC and Apple Pay once the MCX payment system is available 
The retailer however seemed to suggest in its statement that it will support both options Today s consumers have many different ways to spend their money and we want to give our customers as many options as possible in how they pay for goods and services at Best Buy it said 
MCX said in September that CurrentC had been launched in private pilot mode in select locations across the country The pilot would expand through 2014 with regional and national rollouts to follow this year The mobile wallet app will be available to be downloaded for free on both Apple s App Store and Google s Play store MCX said 
Apple Pay got another big win on Monday when card issuer Discover Financial Services said its card members in the U S would be able to make contactless payments using Apple Pay at participating stores through the iPhone 6 iPhone 6 Plus and Apple Watch Discover card members will also be able to make purchases through apps on the iPad Air 2 and iPad mini 3 At launch in October Apple Pay was supported by Visa MasterCard and American Express
