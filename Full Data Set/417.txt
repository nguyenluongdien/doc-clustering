LV County Championship Division One Emirates ICG day three 
Durham beat Nottinghamshire by six wickets 
Durham 19pts Notts 4pts 
Match scorecard 
Durham beat Nottinghamshire by six wickets to secure their third Championship win of 2015 and continue their good start to the season 
Chasing 261 to win Durham began on 15 1 and nightwatchman Mark Wood 66 hit his highest first class score as he put on 116 with Keaton Jennings 61 
Notts took two quick wickets before Scott Borthwick s 51 took Durham close 
Michael Richardson 51 not out ensured Durham completed a three day win leaving Notts still without a victory 
Nottinghamshire have now drawn three and lost one of their opening four matches in the Championship 
Durham reduced their victory target to 154 runs when they reached lunch on 107 1 
Notts gave themselves hope as Luke Wood had Jennings caught by Steven Mullaney at gully while Harry Gurney got one to move sharply to dismiss Mark Wood six overs later 
Wood handled pressure Jennings 
Durham then eased to their victory target thanks largely to a stand of 86 in 14 4 overs between Borthwick and Richardson 
Borthwick hit eight fours in his 65 ball knock for a fourth half century of the season before being trapped lbw by Samit Patel 
Calum MacLeod 21 not out made sure there would be no such problems and struck Patel for a six and a four in one over before hitting the winning run off the same bowler 
He s a tremendous competitor and he looked calm and controlled He took the pressure off me 
We tried to play every ball on its merit knowing we needed to get through the first hour To get through the morning unscathed was a real bonus 
We beat the bat a bit but from a slightly shorter length than is needed here It s not a difficult ground to bowl on 
If you have a first innings lead of 83 here and then lose you have probably bowled pretty poorly 
Having been bowled out for just 163 on Monday in their second batting horror show of the last week you wouldn t have given them much hope of chasing down 261 the highest total in the game 
Eighteen wickets fell on Monday but by lunchtime none had gone today 
Credit to Keaton Jennings and Mark Wood for their stand of 116 runs while it was nice to see half centuries for Scott Borthwick and Michael Richardson as they helped restore some timely confidence
