At 250 unlocked Alcatel OneTouch s Idol 3 costs less than half the price of a high end smartphone But it s not half bad 
The Idol 3 s performance is decent the display is excellent and the battery lasts well over a day If it wasn t for a middling camera you might even wonder why the Idol 3 isn t pricier Now that some carriers such as AT T and T Mobile provide cheaper service when you bring your own handset paying full price for an unlocked phone makes a lot of sense 
While plastic was popular among high end Android handsets just a couple years ago companies like Samsung HTC and Motorola have since migrated to aluminum glass and leather making the Idol 3 look cheap by comparison Still Alcatel has managed to avoid gaudiness with no logos on the front glass and no crazy colors or patterns elsewhere The Idol 3 s wildest design flourish is the silver plastic trim that circles the phone s top and bottom edges 
The phone s easy to grip as well despite its 5 5 inch display The bezels around the screen are narrow enough that you can comfortably reach across with your thumb and the rear panel s brushed matte finish helps form an easy grip At 7 4mm thick the Idol 3 is only a hair thicker than Apple s iPhone 6 Plus 
The Idol 3 is nearly as thin and light as today s best flagship phones 
You won t find fancy features like a thumbprint reader or curved display on the Idol 3 but you shouldn t expect to at this price What s more important is that Alcatel s phone gets the basics down 
The 5 5 inch 1080p display is especially impressive At maximum brightness it s every bit as vibrant as an iPhone 6 Plus with the only minor downsides being shallower blacks and a touch too much redness Viewing angles are solid as well avoiding the washout you sometimes see on low cost phones 
No washed out viewing angles here 
Alcatel also makes a big deal out of the phone s front facing JBL speakers and they indeed fared well against a first generation HTC One which I still consider the gold standard While bass response isn t quite as warm music playback seemed louder without sounding unpleasant 
The good news is that battery life is fantastic Using it as my primary handset I ve yet to experience a day where there s less than 50 percent battery in the tank at the end We re working on our battery rundown test and will post the results shortly 
For software the Idol 3 ships with Android 5 0 2 It s not exactly the latest version but at least it s a fairly clean take on Android Lollipop preserving most of Google s Material Design flourishes Just don t expect stock Android Alcatel has tweaked some of the iconography and open source app designs and has pre loaded the phone with some bloatware apps such as AVG anti virus and the Facetune Lite photo editor The phone comes with 16 GB of internal storage along with a microSD card slot 
Camera quality tends to be the Achilles heel of cheap phones and that includes the Idol 3 The phone s 13 megapixel shooter is capable of decent photos but you need steady hands and the results always looked more yellow than the iPhone 6 Plus and Nexus 6 which I tested alongside the Idol 3 Low light performance is atrocious without flash and the lens had a much tighter angle of view than other phones making it harder to fit more faces in the frame The fact that Alcatel calls its camera industry leading in marketing materials is laughable 
The Idol 3 has many pleasant surprises but the camera is not one of them 
On the bright side Alcatel didn t seriously skimp on the front facing camera which captures at 8 megapixels Minus the drop in detail it s about as serviceable as the rear camera 
There are still clear benefits to buying a phone for 600 or more You ll get better design better performance and a much better camera But Alcatel has done a fine job of narrowing the gap so spending considerably less is no longer a dubious proposition
