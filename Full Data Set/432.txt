Hull City owner Assem Allam says he has rejected offers for the Premier League club as he wants to ensure it goes to a good home 
I ve had offers before and I ve said no Allam told BBC Look North I need someone to look after the club 
If I m looking for money only we d have been sold by now 
He added We have worked hard to reach what we have and we need a good home 
Allam who took charge in 2010 put the club up for sale after his plan to change its name to Hull Tigers was rejected by the Football Association Council 
Allam s relationship with a section of the Hull support has been fractured by the name change issue and Allam Out signs have been displayed at some games this season 
Saturday s defeat to Burnley means Hull must take points from games at Tottenham and at home to Man Utd if they are to have any hope of staying in the Premier League
