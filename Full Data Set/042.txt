Intelligence knits the Office 2016 apps together as does a palpable sense of collaboration If you download and test the new suite you d be well served testing it with a friend or a group of colleagues Many of the new features encourage you to weave data together from diverse sources in the hopes that it will reveal insight 
Office 2016 also shifts how we interact with data in one important way It actively encourages you to share data via the cloud rather than files that you download and append to documents The death of downloading hasn t happened yet but it seems nigh 
You ll need a Microsoft account to take full advantage of what Office 2016 offers 
Remember this is a preview After this story was written the Surface 3 my test machine crashed When it rebooted and updated Outlook and other Office apps wouldn t launch An error message said the operation failed due to an installation problem and I d be forced to reinstall 
Outlook 2016 on the Microsoft Surface 3 
The way Google Apps permits multiple authors to collaborate is the way I expect collaboration to work multiple authors making real time changes to a document with appropriately colored cursors identifying who is making each change Microsoft provides that experience within Office Online but not within the Office desktop apps yet 
Since the Office 2016 preview is literally a work in progress real time co authoring will eventually be added before the software is released as a final product It s not there now Currently the co authoring experience is much more like Office 2013 than anything else 
I quickly hacked together a test document in Word 2016 and sent it off to Brad Chacos via Outlook 2016 As Microsoft executives noted Tuesday morning Word automatically tries to save into OneDrive by default specifically OneDrive for Business Then when you send a file via Outlook the file isn t actually sent just a link is and the user is invited to co edit the document with the appropriate permissions You can also share files directly from Office applications in both Office 2013 and Office 2016 Office 2016 also defaults to a list of recently used files when you attach a document generally listing the latest one first 
In Outlook 2016 most file attachments are links to the file stored in OneDrive If the file isn t there it will be attached 
What we expected to happen of course was for Word to allow us to edit the document collaboratively in Word 2016 or else for Office to open Office Online and do it there Brad was able to sign in with his PCWorld IDG credentials and open the document in app but the real time collaboration was more like playing checkers than Pong Once Brad saved I could see his edits but only if I weren t trying to edit the same text field at the time An alert box also let me know that I wouldn t be seeing real time updates just static changes 
In Word 2016 this seems to be the extent of real time editing for now 
Otherwise most Office 2016 apps are virtually identical to Office 2013 for now I did notice a slightly narrower less legible menu font during my testing on a Surface 3 compared to what Brad saw on his desktop which could be a scaling issue with our different displays 
One of the more useful features of Office 2016 is the specialized search bar at the top of many of the Office apps The Tell me bar as Microsoft calls it invites you to ask in the search field how to perform actions such as adding footnotes rather than hunt the feature down through a maze of menus The best part is that it doesn t tell you how to perform a specific function it simply offers you a simple step to actually do it 
The Tell me search bar allows you to simply ask the app what you want to do At this point it doesn t work all that well 
Unfortunately it sometimes flops In Outlook 2015 I tried searching for out of office instead of the more Office like automatic replies Neither query worked whether as a search for the terms themselves or a more naturally phrased query In Word however searches for insert bold text insert footnote and find Web art all brought up what I was looking for 
One drawback however is the Tell me bar doesn t actually reveal in what menu your search result is hiding so you don t learn how to find it yourself next time Short of becoming dependent upon Tell me perhaps a secondary take me there button makes sense too at least as an option 
Groups within Office 2016 
Visually Excel 2016 at this point looks virtually identical to its Office 2013 version The difference however is what s under the hood 
You can quickly extrapolate forecasts in Excel 2016 
One feature that Microsoft did add however is one click forecasting which mines your data for trends and extrapolates them out for a few periods of time The Tell me search bar discovered that capability but unfortunately I couldn t find the new charts and graphs that Microsoft says are in the new version TreeMap Sunburst Waterfall Box Whisker and Histogram Pareto to test out 
I didn t see anything new or noteworthy in either OneNote or PowerPoint I did notice that notes loaded slowly in the new app but that may have been a quirk of my network 
Eventually Office apps won t just talk to each other but hold their own conversations with outside apps 
Eventually that capability will spread throughout the Office suite but that will take time Chris Johnson a group product marketing manager at Microsoft said last week at Build that Microsoft was opening up APIs behind OneNote for example but the extensibility shown on stage wasn t yet there Being able to surface developers interrogations or solutions inside our products we see as really key to building nice productivity solutions he said 
Like the Windows 10 Insider program expect new capabilities to be added to Office 2016 over time The key question Will Microsoft do enough to lure you off the preview when it expires Because you ll be in step with Microsoft as Office 2016 rolls out you re in good shape to answer that question
