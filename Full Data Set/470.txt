Welsh golfer Rhys Davies ended his horrible five year wait for a title with a four shot victory at the Turkish Airlines Challenge 
A two under par 70 at the Gloria Golf Resort in Belek was enough to secure his first win since the 2010 Troph√©e Hassan on the European Tour 
The 29 year old finished 14 under overall in Turkey to seal a third career European Challenge Tour title 
It s a bit of a surprise to be honest said Davies 
Sometimes it s been really horrible in the last couple of years I m not going to pretend 
It does feel like a long time since I ve won but it s strange that when you get in the mix everything floods back to you 
Davies finished four shots ahead of runner up Lorenzo Gagli from Italy 
The Welshman s victory capped a significant revival after a difficult few years for the Bridgend player who was ranked 44th in the world in 2010 before falling to 181st place in 2014 
It s been quite dark sometimes but I always felt that if I could get in the mix I could win again I didn t doubt that to be honest said Davies 
But I couldn t see it happening any time soon at various moments 
I ve been very fortunate that a number of people have been very supportive of me during my tough times 
Former Ryder Cup player Phillip Price is one in particular He s been exceptionally supportive
