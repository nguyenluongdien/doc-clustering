The U S Federal Aviation Administration has announced tests of drones in urban areas as well as outside the pilot s line of sight possibly paving the way for operations such as the aerial delivery of packages as proposed by companies like Amazon com 
PrecisionHawk a drone manufacturer will be surveying crops in rural areas using unmanned aircraft flying outside of the pilot s direct vision while BNSF Railroad will test the unmanned aircraft systems UAS to inspect their rail infrastructure beyond visual line of sight in isolated areas Huerta said at a conference of the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems International 
News network CNN will be testing drones for news gathering in urban areas 
Huerta described the proposed rules as containing commonsense provisions like not flying near airports at night or more than 500 feet off the ground 
While the FAA addresses over 4 000 comments on the proposal before finalizing the rule which would take time it is meanwhile looking for other ways to expand the use of unmanned aircraft 
We anticipate receiving valuable data from each of these trials that could result in FAA approved operations in the next few years Huerta said 
The FAA also released at the conference a smartphone app called B4UFLY that users can use to determine whether there are any restrictions or requirements in effect at the location where they want to fly their UAS The FAA is inviting volunteers to test the app with plans to release to about 1 000 beta testers It will be available on iOS first with an Android version to follow
