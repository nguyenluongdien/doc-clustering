Drivers for Web based ride hailing services in Massachusetts would be subject to criminal background checks by the state and their company if a bill unveiled Friday by the state s governor becomes law 
The proposed law would place such services in a new regulatory category called transportation network companies and require them to obtain a special license from the state Department of Public Utilities which oversees other modes of transportation To cover the cost of this oversight the companies would be subject to a yearly tax based on the revenue they earn in the state Details on how the tax would be calculated weren t provided 
The state s background check would entail pulling up all records of an individual s criminal court appearances in Massachusetts Drivers with criminal backgrounds would be prohibited by the state from working for car hailing companies However the types of offenses that would disqualify a person from driving weren t defined 
The law would require companies like Uber and Lyft to provide the state with a list of its drivers and their addresses and to keep that roster updated This information would be shared with the registry of motors vehicles and state and local law enforcement Transportation companies would also have to verify that the vehicles used by drivers are registered in Massachusetts and have passed the state s safety inspection 
In an effort to better identify cars being used by Uber and Lyft drivers their vehicles would need to include an external maker Some people have mistakenly entered vehicles that they assumed were their Uber or Lyft rides 
The bill also includes insurance provisions such as requiring drivers to have at least US 1 million in insurance coverage when transporting passengers 
Under the bill a five person public safety advisory committee would be appointed by the governor and include representatives from Boston and two neighboring cities where the service is popular with residents 
Uber backs the legislation saying the bill would promote innovation and keep Uber drivers and passengers safe said Meghan Joyce Uber East Coast general manager in a statement Massachusetts residents have shown they support ride hailing and Lyft will work with the state to pass legislation that maintains this transportation option according to the company 
Governments are looking to regulate Web based ride hailing companies which allow people to summon a ride by using an app on their smartphones as people increasingly use these services instead of taxis to get around Taxi drivers consider services like Uber and Lyft a threat and have rallied against them 
In the U S Arizona Maryland Virginia Tennessee and Utah have enacted legislation to regulate Internet based passenger services
