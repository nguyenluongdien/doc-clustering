Toby Alderweireld says Southampton are in pole position to sign him from parent club Atletico Madrid but admits he is in the dark over his future 
The defender is on loan at Saints until the end of the season 
Southampton are in a good position because I know the club the 26 year old Belgian told BBC Radio Solent 
They are very good to me I did a great job for them as well so we have a good connection I really like the Premier League If Atletico want me back I have to listen I can t give the answer I really don t know 
In April the Spanish club s sporting director Jose Luis Perez Caminero said they were counting on Alderweireld who can play in the centre of defence or right back for next season 
Saints have a 6 8m option to buy the Belgian at the end of the season but Atletico can buy out that clause for 1 5m and then sell to the highest bidder or choose to keep the player 
Alderweireld admits the uncertainty over his future is unsettling and he would like it resolved as soon as possible 
It s difficult for me in my head he said 
Where am I going to live Where am I going to play I just don t know which way it is going to go 
Toby Alderweireld has won 37 caps for Belgium
