Apple has warned that an European probe into its tax payments in Ireland could lead to the company having to pay disputed past taxes covering up to 10 years 
The company said the impact could be material but did not provide an estimate 
The investigation would address rulings by Irish tax authorities on the calculation of the taxable profit allocated to the Irish branches of Apple Sales International and of Apple Operations Europe to find out if the rulings involved state aid that benefited the company 
EU member states are banned from providing financial assistance in a way that distorts competition including through tax rulings Tax rulings may involve state aid within the meaning of EU rules if they are used to provide selective advantages to a specific company or group of companies the EC said in June while announcing the probe 
The Commission also started investigations at the time into taxes paid by two non tech companies in two other EU member states which like Ireland are seen as low tax jurisdictions The EC said that besides the Apple investigation it would also investigate Starbucks in the Netherlands and Fiat Finance and Trade in Luxembourg 
While such amount could be material as of March 28 2015 the Company is unable to estimate the impact Apple said
