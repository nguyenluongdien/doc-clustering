Sebastian Vettel says there is still a big gap between his Ferrari team and rivals Mercedes 
Vettel 27 said Not so long ago three months we were here for winter testing and the gap between everyone and Mercedes was huge 
What has happened since then for us is very positive but the gap is still there and it is still big 
Vettel is third in the championship one point adrift of Mercedes Nico Rosberg and 28 points behind world champion Lewis Hamilton who has won three of the four races and finished second behind Vettel in Malaysia Mercedes also lead the constructors championship with Ferrari in second place 
Vettel said he hoped a series of aerodynamic upgrades on the Ferrari for the Spanish Grand Prix this weekend would reduce the gap still further 
Barcelona historically has always been a place where teams have brought updates to its cars sometimes bigger or smaller Vettel said 
We ve probably done the same as everyone else but hopefully we ll have a bigger update and a better lap time to catch up to the guys in front Mercedes 
Lewis Hamilton claimed his only Spanish Grand Prix win at last year s race
