Nottingham Rugby head coach Martin Haag has signed a new two year contract 
The 46 year old former England forward joined the Green Whites in 2012 and guided them to their highest ever league position of second in the Championship the following year 
Nottingham just missed out no a play off place this term finishing fifth 
A year and a half ago perhaps I wouldn t have signed but I feel we are much more stable 
We are still on a very limited budget compared to other teams so we know it will be tough But I am really pleased with the squad We have some exciting prospects coming in 
We re a work in progress coming off of a very good season and I m excited to build on what we ve started
