Colombia s High Commissioner for Peace Sergio Jaramillo has ruled out a blanket amnesty for members of Colombia s Farc rebel group 
Mr Jaramillo who is part of the government team engaged in peace talks with the Farc in Havana said that the days when you could say that there ll be a blanket amnesty are over 
The two sides have reached agreement on three out of five topics at the talks 
The Marxist rebels have been fighting the government for more than 50 years 
The Colombian government negotiators and a delegation of Farc rebels started holding formal peace talks in November 2012 in the Cuban capital Havana 
An estimated 220 000 killed 
More than five million internally displaced 
More than seven million registered victims 
About 8 000 Farc rebels continue fighting

Briefing journalists at the Colombian embassy in London Mr Jaramillo acknowledged there had been stumbling blocks on the road to peace 
Mr Jaramillo said the attack had caused disillusionment among Colombians and prompted many to doubt the intentions of the Farc 
But he said that despite the tragic and terrible nature of the attack it was key that the government negotiators persevere and keep pushing 
He said that during the more than two years he had negotiated with the Farc in Havana he had got the feeling that the rebels had taken on board that you need to take the victims seriously 
A total of 60 victims have travelled to Havana and spoken to both the Farc and the government negotiators about their experiences 
Mr Jaramillo said crimes against humanity committed by the rebels as well as those by state actors would be investigated 
You have to be prepared to recognise your own mistakes and your own responsibility he said 
If you re not prepared to acknowledge your own responsibility you don t really have the moral authority to ask the other guys to do so 
He said it was key for the negotiators to find the right balance between justice and peace and while it would be very very difficult he remained convinced it would be possible to find a sensible solution 
Mr Jaramillo concluded that despite the current mistrust created by the deadly Farc attack in April he was confident that if the two sides did reach an agreement a lot of people would pinch themselves and say I can t believe this happened in my lifetime because nobody had thought this was possible
