Campaigners are urging Facebook to act against what they describe as Russian attempts to silence pro Ukrainian voices 
They say numerous accounts critical of the Kremlin have been suspended following false reports of abuse filed from Russia 
Ukraine s president has urged Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg to create a special administrative office to deal with the complaints 
Russia has not commented on the claims 
Ukraine does need a Ukrainian Facebook office 
The top responses to Mr Zuckerberg s invitation were overwhelmingly pro Ukrainian 
Create a separate administration for the Ukrainian segment block abuse reports from Russia or maybe just monitor more carefully top Ukrainian bloggers but somehow help us please it said 
In recent weeks several prominent Ukrainian users of Facebook have had their accounts suspended after posting updates critical of Russia or Moscow backed separatists in eastern Ukraine 
Henadiy Moskal the plain speaking governor of the restive Luhansk region had his Facebook account blocked after sharing a photo of himself standing next to a poster with an obscenity aimed at the separatists 
Russians themselves are not immune from the apparent campaign to silence Kremlin critics on Facebook 
Facebook later said this was done in error 
The Kremlin has not commented on these claims while Facebook is yet to respond to the calls for a separate administrative office to deal with comments on Ukraine
