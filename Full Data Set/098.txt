Microsoft has lost the latest round in a patent infringement case that could lead to an import ban on its phones 
Administrative Law Judge Theodore Essex of the U S International Trade Commission ruled on Monday that Nokia and Microsoft Mobile products infringed two patents held by R D company InterDigital Essex s decision is preliminary and will be reviewed by the full commission which is expected to announce its final ruling on Aug 28 The final ruling could lead to a ban on importing the phones into the U S 
Companies with patented technology that s included in standards typically have to license it on terms that are considered fair reasonable and non discriminatory Judge Essex found no sign that InterDigital tried to license its technology on unfair terms and he did find evidence that Nokia and Microsoft weren t willing to pay for a license that was offered on reasonable terms InterDigital said 
Microsoft downplayed the significance of the preliminary decision 
This is one step in the process and we look forward to the full Commission s thorough review the company said in a statement We have a successful track record challenging patent assertion entities that misuse industry standards 
InterDigital filed the case in 2007 and lost at the ITC the first time the case was heard there but it won an appeal in federal court That appeals court then sent the dispute back to the ITC where it s being heard now
