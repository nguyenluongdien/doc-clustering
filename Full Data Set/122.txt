It s exactly 100 years since the teenage Willie Hutchinson stumbled across a few pieces of opal while walking in the Australian Outback 
Today the settlement even refers to itself as the opal capital of the world with the wider Australian deposits producing more than 80 of the world s precious opals 
Coober Pedy s gemstones are known for their clear or whitish colour but some will dazzle like a rainbow Experts talk of church windows to describe examples that mimic stained glass 
This is a designation being devised by an international group of geologists The intention is to name and define those stones deemed to have particular significance in human culture 
But there are also many famous ornamental and precious stones that could claim equally significant heritage and as a consequence the geologists now find themselves examining the limits of qualification 
GHSR status no stone has yet been designated will be important for architects and conservators when they have to restore old buildings for example 
It will make it easier for them to stipulate very specific materials confident in how they will perform and weather over time 
It may also offer some protection to the quarries and mines from which the designated stones are sourced 
If nothing else GHSR status would be a marketing fillip 
But not all geologists are happy with the idea of the gemstones inclusion 
For these critics the opals with their limited supply and wide ranging use in jewellery are deemed to be too far removed from the original spirit of the initiative which was to promote the classic dimension stones those cut or shaped to be used for building 
There is a sense also in which they are too processed And in any case the detractors argue the opals are so diverse in form and colour that it will actually be very difficult to give them a clear and tight description 
Barry Cooper on the other hand believes his national gemstone just scrapes under the bar The South Australian is the secretary of the Heritage Stone Task Group of the International Union of Geological Sciences 
Some of my colleagues are up in arms he conceded 
Where s the limit If you ask me I d say stones like diamonds and sapphires are far too manufactured But stones like opal are not only jewellery gemstones they can also be used in sculpture and mosaics they broach across into art And that gives them a deeper cultural significance 
The crux is that there is probably some value in them being designated 
Highly acidic fluids dissolved silica from quartz rich sandstones that then later precipitated as precious opal 
These circumstances are quite different from some of the world s other opal fields which may trace their origin to a volcanic setting not the sedimentary one seen in Australia 
Whatever its merits the gemstone will have to wait its turn 
The Global Heritage Stone Resource project formally got under way in 2008 Only seven years later are geologists close to acknowledging their first designation 
This is likely to go to Portland stone the redoubtable English building block quarried in Dorset on the south coast of England 
Michael Poultney is the MD of Albion Stone Plc its biggest producer 
I see the designation as recognising those stones that have made a massive contribution to the built environment not just locally but internationally as well he told BBC News 
Portland stone has been used across the world in Belgium and in Holland and even in New York in buildings such as the UN 
Getting the designation would mean a huge amount to us on the international market Foreign buyers assume it s not available in commercial quantities and we re trying to dispel that myth Designation would also give us kudos
