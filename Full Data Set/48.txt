Huawei Technologies is seeking to double its retail presence around the world amid a growing a pushing to sell more mid range and high end smartphones 
The Chinese handset maker aims to establish 70 000 retail spaces by the end of 2017 up from the 30 000 locations it already has including Huawei stores product counters and display zones where its smartphones were shown for sale last year 
More than half of those locations are in China the company s home market said Glory Zhang chief marketing officer for Huawei s consumer business group The balance will start to change by year end when Huawei brings more high end products to international markets she added 
Although Huawei isn t as well known as Apple or Samsung it has been gradually building up its smartphone brand and growing its market share Last year the company shipped 75 million smartphones up from 52 million a year ago This made Huawei the world s third largest vendor for all of last year according to research firm IDC 
To compete and pull in consumers Chinese brands have often relied on selling low priced handsets but Huawei has been finding buyers for its more expensive devices 
In this year s first quarter its mid range and high end smartphones made up 34 percent of its total smartphone shipments Last year the figure was 5 percent Zhang added 
The company has laid out another ambitious goal with its plan to create retail service centers around the globe These centers will be within 5 kilometers of customers and intend to offer after sales services such as product repairs It s unclear when the company intends to accomplish the goal 
For Huawei however the plan is to make a substantial profit from smartphones and not simply sell huge volumes said Eric Xu Huawei s acting CEO on Tuesday during the company s annual analyst summit 
We ve done this for a long time she said We feel deeply that it s easy to make a phone but hard to make a good one
