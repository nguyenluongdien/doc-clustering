If Pele is the most famous name in the history of the Brazilian men s team then Marta occupies the same role in the women s Selecao 
Having won Fifa s world player of the year award on five consecutive occasions between 2006 and 2010 there is no doubting the credentials of the 29 year old forward 
Many defences have been torn apart by her strong running superb control and hammer of a left foot She has scored 79 goals in 91 appearances for her country 
But where Pele helped lead Brazil to three World Cup victories Marta and her colleagues have narrowly missed out on the success their country craves 
They lost in the 2007 World Cup final to Germany and were beaten by the United States in extra time of the 2004 and 2008 Olympic finals 
Aiming for a first World Cup crown for the Selecao this summer Marta is undeterred 
The team has the ability to get a good result and I believe we can get through to the final she said 
This dream is not just mine but the team s and a dream for all the other girls back in Brazil who are rooting for our success 
Marta has been a runner up with Brazil at the 2007 World Cup and the 2004 and 2008 Olympics
