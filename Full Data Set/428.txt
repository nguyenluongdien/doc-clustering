Match scorecard 
Four wickets each for Neil Dexter and Steven Finn helped Middlesex beat Sussex and remain top of Division One 
Having resumed on 126 6 John Simpson made 34 to take Middlesex to 209 all out and set the hosts 287 to win 
Michael Yardy s measured innings of 52 got Sussex off to a good start but Dexter picked up four wickets as they slumped from 91 1 to 147 6 
Finn removed Ben Brown and Oliver Robinson and then had Ajmal Shahzad caught behind to seal the victory 
After a second day in which 13 wickets had fallen the bowlers were once again on top early on as Ollie Rayner was caught off the bowling of Robinson with just 17 runs added to the overnight score 
But Simpson and James Harris 28 put on 45 for the eighth wicket as the leaders set third placed Sussex a challenging target for victory 
Openers Yardy and Chris Nash saw off the new ball but Toby Roland Jones struck shortly after lunch Nash edging to first slip 
Dexter picked up his first wicket as Matt Machan was caught driving to mid on and then had Ed Joyce caught behind for a duck 
Craig Cachopa and Luke Wright were bowled by Finn and Dexter respectively before Johannesburg born Dexter had Yardy caught by wicketkeeper Simpson 
Brown and Robinson made 38 for the seventh wicket but both fell in quick succession to England hopeful Finn 
Off spinner Rayner found Steve Magoffin s outside edge and Simpson took his third catch of the innings to remove Shahzad and seal Middlesex s third win in four games 
It was a poor wicket We are trying to get more pace and bounce into our pitches but that probably did too much there were too many naughty balls 
We were outplayed and can t have any complaints but we did give ourselves a chance to win and that s a positive for us 
My honest assessment is that it wasn t a great wicket I just felt the variable bounce combined with the sideways movement from the first day made it difficult and the fact that only one batsman got to 50 proved that 
I had a bit of a hunch with Neil Dexter and he did a terrific job He found enough sideways movement and getting Michael Yardy just before tea was crucial He gets wickets in clusters 
We have started tremendously well It s a close knit group and they are very talented so there s no reason why we can t continue our good start
