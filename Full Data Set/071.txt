U S Senator Rand Paul a Republican presidential candidate has introduced legislation that would overturn the Federal Communications Commission s recent net neutrality rules 
Paul said he doesn t want the FCC regulate the Internet The net neutrality rules prohibit broadband providers from selectively blocking or slowing Web traffic and from charging websites and services for prioritized access to customers but the rules do not regulate Internet content 
Digital rights group Free Press slammed Paul for introducing the resolution saying he s ignoring the wishes of millions of U S residents who support the rules 
Senator Paul has no idea what Net Neutrality is Matt Wood the group s policy director said by email His opposition to common sense open Internet principles shows how little he knows or cares about the law and the overwhelming support these rules have from businesses innovators and individual Internet users 
Paul and other opponents of net neutrality rules have sided with the phone and cable lobby and against the open Internet Wood added
